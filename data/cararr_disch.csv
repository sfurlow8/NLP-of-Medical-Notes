Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular fibrillation arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arctic sun cooling protocol.

History of Present Illness:
53-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation presented
after having v-fib arrest. At her nursing home this morning she
was found down. EMS was called, finding her to be in v-fib. She
received shocks x 3, 6 mg total of epinephrine, 300 mg loading
dose of amiodarone then drip. Intubated in the field. She was
transported to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where she was given 1 unit of pRBCs.
Guaiac reportedly negative. Got a total of 2.5 L of NS. Started
on Artic Sun before med flight to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was found cold with 8mm fixed
pupils bilaterally and no response to stimuli. SBP was in the
140s-160s without pressor, HR 50s-60s. ECG showed... She got a
head CT and chest CTA. Transferred to CCU for further
management.
.
Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2161-8-12**] to [**2161-8-17**]
for syncope and runs of VT. Prior to this admission, OSH ETT had
shown possible mild basal inferior ischemia vs. attenuation
artifact with overall normal systolic function. She underwent
cardiac catheterization, which showed a 90% distal RCA stenosis,
and a DES was placed in the RCA. TTE and TEE showed a large (21
mm) secundum atrial septal defect with LVEF>55%. Review of her
strip rhythm suggested that her arrhythmia may be atrial in
origin rather than ventricular tachycardia. For that reason, she
underwent an EP study on [**2161-8-14**], which included ventricular
stimulation as well as assessment for atrial arrhythmias.  She
was found to have inducible atrial flutter, that was typical
counter clockwise flutter and she had a successful isthmus
ablation. She had no sustained ventricular tachycardia with
ventricular stimulation protocol. She was evaluated by the
cardiac surgeons as well as the interventional cardiologists for
percutaneous surgical closure of her large secundum ASD, and it
was deemed that this should be done as an outpatient. In
addition, with her history of significant atrial arrhythmias and
atrial fibrillation, it was thought that a pulmonary vein
isolation procedure would be beneficial prior to any closure of
her secundum ASD.

.
ECHO [**11-6**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. A large secundum atrial septal defect is
present. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**11-7**] CXR:
New right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. ET tube is in
standard
position. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly is
stable. The main pulmonary arteries are dilated. Multifocal
consolidations
in the upper and lower lobes have improved. There is no
pneumothorax or
pleural effusion.
.
[**11-8**] MRI head:
FINDINGS: Increased FLAIR-T2 signal in the entire cerebral
cortex, medial
temporal lobe (hippocampus) and basal ganglia and thalamus
correspond to areas of decreased diffusion. There is no
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  The ventricles and
extra-axial spaces are within normal limits. Flow void in
visualized intracranial arteries is consistent with their
patency. Mucosal thickening with probable air-fluid levels in
the bilateral sphenoid sinuses are noted. Visualized orbits are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse cerebral anoxic injury. No intracranial
hemorrhage.
.
[**11-12**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the
monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The
ventilation of the lung parenchyma is improved. However, a
pre-existing small retrocardiac atelectasis is slightly
increased in extent. Minimal areas of atelectasis are also seen
at the medial basal right aspect of the hemithorax. Focal
parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia are not present.
Marked cardiomegaly with signs of mild overhydration and
increase of the carinal angle, most likely caused by increasing
diameter of the left atrium. No evidence of pneumothorax, no
larger pleural effusions.
.
EEG [**11-6**]:
This is an abnormal video EEG study due to a burst
suppression pattern with initial frequent electrographic
seizures
consisting of persistent eye opening and upward deviation that
improved
in frequency and duration over the course of this recording.
Compared
to the first half of this recording when rare electrographic
seizures
were occurring every five to ten minutes and lasting up to eight
seconds
in duration, there were no seizures in the latter half of this
record.
Electrographic seizures increased in duration with increase in
midazolam
doses, then abated and were replaced by a burst-suppression
pattern
after propofol was started. These findings are indicative of
severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction and nonconvulsive status
epilepticus, both
of which portend a poor neurologic outcome in this patient with
anoxic
brain injury.
.
[**11-10**] EEG:
This is an abnormal video EEG study due to burst
suppression in background activity with intermittent 1 Hz
generalized
sharp and slow wave discharges with bifrontal predominance
consistent
with generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs). These

findings suggest a severe encephalopathy consistent with the
patient's history of anoxic brain injury. There were no
electrographic
seizures seen during this recording. This telemetry captured no
pushbutton activations. Compared to the prior 24 hours, this EEG
is
unchanged.
.
[**11-12**] EP:
After stimulation of either
median nerve there were well-formed evoked potential peaks and
at the
P/N13 waveform position, but there were no discernible peaks (or
even
modest deflections) at the N19 waveform position. These studies
suggest
a normal peripheral large fiber somatosensory conduction through
the
brachioplexus and medulla, but there was absence of any signal
from
thalama cortical areas. Assuming the absence of medication
effect, this
is a poor prognostic sign in coma.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for v-fib arrest and treated with
arctic sun protocol and medical management of her MI.  She
required pressor support and remained intubated on propofol.
She was monitored on EEG and showed increasing EEG activity when
propofol was weaned.  She was started on anti-seizure
medications with some improvement in her EEG tracings, however
evoked potential testing was performed and showed no conduction
beyond the medulla and therefore it was determined that her
potential for meaningful recovery was extremely low, therefore
patient made comfort-measures-only (CMO) following a discussion
between the patient's HCP (her brother [**Name (NI) 4468**] [**Name (NI) 83106**]) and the
CCU team. Palliative care and social work were involved as was
the chaplain's office. Patient was extubated, and approximately
24 hours later she died. Death was pronounced, the patient's
brother [**Name (NI) 382**] was notified, autopsy was declined, attending
notified, death paperwork completed.

Chief Complaint:
Found down, s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
28 y/o male with unknown PMH who was found down in [**Location (un) 538**]
after 911 call. His identity was initially unknown on admission
on [**2192-8-9**] and he was identified on [**2192-8-11**]. Physician was
driving by the scene with his wife and responded by initiating
CPR approximately 15 minutes after man went down. EMS arrived on
the scene soon after call was made by unknown observer. Patient
was a well-dressed male thought to be in his 30s without any
evidence of track marks or drug use. His pupils were dilated. He
was intubated in the field. He was found in PEA arrest.
According to rhythm strips obtained from EMS, his first rhythm
was sinus bradycardia and he was given epinephrine and atropine.
He then went into WCT followed by MMVT. He was then shocked with
200 J and rhythm became PMVT and was shocked for the second time
with 300 J. He then went into ST and recovery of pulse. He
received a total of 2 mg of epinephrine and 2 mg of atropine
with 2 shocks (200 and 300J). He was then transported to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.
.
In the ED, his pupils were fixed and dilated B/L. FAST was
negative. CXR revealed distended stomach. CT of head, chest,
abdomen, pelvis, C-spine were all negative. The patient was
transferred to the CCU hemodynamically stable on the ventilator.

Imaging Studies:
1. CXR [**2192-8-9**]
The ET tube tip is positioned approximately 2 cm from the
carina. There has been interval placement of an OG tube,
extending beyond the GE junction, though the tip is not
visualized on this study. The cardiac and the mediastinal
contours are within normal limits. The lungs are clear. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. The soft tissue and
osseous structures are stable in appearance.
IMPRESSION: The OG tube extends beyond the GE junction, though
the tip is not visualized on this image.
.
2. CT Head, C-spine, Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis W/Contrast
The study is limited secondary to motion. No definite hemorrhage
is identified.
No fracture or subluxation.
No evidence of traumatic injury.
.
3. Echo [**2192-8-10**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed with mild global hypokinesis more
prominent in the distal inferior, distal septal and apical
segments. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion. EF 45%
.
4. EEG [**2192-8-10**]
This is a markedly abnormal electroencephalogram due to the
presence of a suppressed background interrupted by rhythmic
sharply
contoured and evolving epileptiform activity. This EEG is
consistent
with brief periods of electrographic seizures on a suppressed
background. The team was called and notified of this result.
.
5. EEG [**2192-8-13**]
This is an abnormal 24 hour bedside telemetry due to the
presence of a low voltage, diffusely slow background activity.
This
suppressed activity may be seen with diffuse subcortical
dysfunction, as
occurs with CNS depressant medications or diffuse cerebral
ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
28 y/o male with no known PMH at the time found down s/p cardiac
arrest. PEA then VT then VF. Successful resuscitation with 2
shocks. The patient suffered anoxic brain injury s/p cardiac
arrest.
.
1. s/p cardiac arrest
The patient was initially found down in [**Location (un) 538**]. Please
see above HPI for further details. After arriving at [**Hospital1 18**] ED,
he was ruled out for any traumatic injury. He was then
transferred to the CCU for further evaluation and management
after his cardiac arrest. Due to his recent VF arrest, the
hypothermia protocol was initiated and the patient was cooled
for 18 hours. GCS before protocol was initiated was 3. The
patient met all inclusion criteria and he had none of the
exclusion criteria. Following the cooling protocol, he was
re-warmed. Upon initial arrival to the CCU, his EKG was analyzed
for any evidence of arrhythmia or abnormality that would explain
his cardiac arrest. Echocardiogram was performed soon after the
patient arrived in the CCU which was negative for any structural
abnormality of the heart. See full echo report above for
details. Initial tox screen was positive for opiates and benzos.
The leading diagnosis after cardiac causes were ruled out were
possible substance abuse causing respiratory suppression then
hypoxia which may have induced the cardiac arrest. Since the
patient was never awake from presentation, obtaining any HPI was
impossible. After talking with his family, they mentioned that
he had a history of substance abuse and was most likely using
heroin and/or benzos prior to being found down. The exact
etiology of what caused the patient's cardiac arrest remained
uncertain. Due to the patient's anoxic brain injury and after
consulting neurology, the family decided to withdraw support on
[**2192-8-15**] and the patient expired soon afterwards.
.
2. Anoxic brain injury
After the patient was transferred to the CCU, neurology was
consulted so they could perform an exam while patient was off
sedation prior to initiating cooling protocol. Upon arrival to
the CCU, the patient was having myoclonic jerking which was more
consistent with anoxic brain injury than seizure activity.
Neurology recommended EEG and then continued EEG monitoring. On
initial exam, the patient did have a gag reflex and corneal
reflexes. However, as his hospital course progressed, all of his
reflexes were absent, even off sedation for 48 hours. He was
monitored continuously with EEG which showed no signs of
activity. He was maintained initially on Dilantin to control any
seizures secondary to anoxic brain injury and that was
eventually discontinued. Organ bank saw the patient and
determined that he was not a suitable candidate for organ
donation. During the last two days of the patient's
hospitalization, he began to show evidence of multi-organ

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 109603**] is a 48 yo male with a h/o schizophrenia and CAD who
had a witnessed cardiac arrest at [**Company **].  Per report, AED
advised shockable rhythm x 2.  Patient vomited after the first
shock.  He was down for approximately 35 minute prior to arrival
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was agitated, unable to provide
name, with noted to have son[**Name (NI) 7884**] respirations.  Patient was
unable to provide any additional history.  ABG 6.96/92/114. EKG
was reported as NSR with HR [**Street Address(2) 109604**] elevations in the inferior
leads with ST depressions in V2-V3, and code STEMI was called.
He was intubated due to hypoxia, SpO2.  Patient had asystolic
arrest and was given epi 1 mg and atropine 1 mg.  He was
subsequently shocked x 2 for vfib.  Amiodarone 150 mg IV and
lidocaine 100 mg IV were given. Patient was transported to the
cath lab with delay due to VT arrest in ED.  Prior to cath lab,
patient received Plavix 600 mg [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325 mg PO, and was
started on a heparin gtt.
.
In the cath lab he was found to have 3V disease. No intervention
was performed.  Course was complicated by perforation of left
superficial femoral artery, and patient was taken directly to OR

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with hypertension, cerebrovascular disease,
and peripheral vascular disease who presented after 10-14 days
of progressive chest pain and shortness of breath with witnessed
cardiac arrest in ED resulting in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
She presented intubated and unconscious off sedation to the
cardiac care unit. The patient was started on dopamine infusion
for inotropic pressure support in the ED but had reached maximum
dose available. She was switched to levophed and dobutamine for
better blood pressure control assessed by a peripheral arterial
line that was placed in the CCU. Beta blockade was held for
hypotension.  She received aspirin and was started on
intravenous heparin. She had been given amiodarone and lidocaine
for her arrhythmia, which were discontinued.  By echocardiogram,
her LVEF was 10%, suggesting she had experienced significant
cardiac dysfunction. Additionally, her CK and troponin T
continued to climb, indicating large scale, ongoing cardiac
damage. On telemetry, the patient exhibited various conduction
blockade, including eposodic Weinkebach grouped beating.
.
The patient likely developed anoxic brain damage due to
signficant cardiac arrest in the setting of baseline
cerebrovascular disease. She was at presentation nonresponsive
without any sedation with decorticate posturing to painful
stimuli without evidence of normal withdrawal response. Babinski
sign was postive bilaterally but more pronounced on the left.
Pupils were fixed and dilated. She had ittle spontaneous limb
movement and poor peripheral capillary refill.
.
She became febrile to >105 rectally during her [**Last Name (un) 102218**] CCU
course. Blood cultures were obtained and results were pending at
time of death.  The patient's sister, [**Name (NI) 13118**], and several other
family members were present at the time of death. They had opted
on the telephone earlier in the day to apply DNR/DNI status per
the patient's wishes expressed to multiple family members. The
patient was kept intubated on pressors until the family made the
decision to withdraw aggressive care, pursuing comfort measures
only instead. The patient was successfully extubated without
complication and the IV infusions were discontinued. IV morphine
was given for comfort without overly reducing respiratory rate.
The patient expired within an hour later with family present and
last rites were obtained.

were impaired.  Her cognitive examination was abnormal in her
inability to do serial sevens.  She was able to do serial
threes.  She remembered 2 out of 3 in five minutes.
Calculations and fund of knowledge were within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Four.
A trial of Depakote ER was begun to help with her impulsive
behaviors.  Her family and her outpatient physicians were
contact[**Name (NI) **].  The patient was pleasant and involved in MILU
activities.  She did have a fall on the unit with no acute
injuries noted and fall precautions were put into place.  Her
family met with the inpatient team as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3088**] who
reviewed her recent MRI and said that it showed worsening of
her demyelinating disorder, which could be consistent with
her current change in behavior.  He would continue to follow
her.  The patient had no further urges or attempts to engage
anyone sexually and was in very good control on the unit.
She did have another fall using her walker and began to use
her wheel chair more frequently.  She denies side effects
from the Depakote.  On [**5-30**] she complained of an upset
stomach, diarrhea and a productive cough for three days with
some blood in her sputum.  She denied any shortness of
breath.  Lungs were clear on examination.  The patient had an
extensive physical therapy consult and evaluation and further
physical therapy was recommended.

Discharge planning proceeded with the patient agreeing to go
to a brief rehab stay for continued physical therapy before
returning home.  On [**2169-5-31**] the patient was being assisted in
transfer from bed to her wheel chair and had a sudden cardiac
and respiratory arrest.  CPR was initiated and she was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

In the MICU, the patient was in pulseless electrical activity
(PEA) and was felt to have suffered a massive pulmonary
embolism. She was given thrombolysis with restoration of pulse
and blood pressure while being maintained on vasopressors and
mechanical ventilation. However, despite maximum supportive
measures, hypotension became refractory and the patient died
within 24 hours of transfer to the ICU. The patient's family was
notified of the events and was with the patient in her final
hours.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 YO M with extensive past medical history presenting s/p
witnessed pulseless arrest with questionable bystandard CPR.
His cardiac enzymes were positive and it is possible that his
arrest was secondary to myocardial infarction; or equally
possible that he had a primary arrhthmic event.  Upon arrival to
the CCU he had signs of very severe neurologic injury with GSC
of [**3-5**] off of sedation with absolutely no response to pain, no
gag reflex, abnormal doll's eyes, no corneal reflex.  His only
sign of brainstem function were sluggish pupil response.  He was
intubated for airway protection; neurology was consulted.  He
was also acidotic/hyperkalemic which was treated with dextrose,
insulin, bicarbonate, and kayexalate to good effect.  He was
mechanically ventilated on assist control mode.  At the
suggestion of Neurology his sedation was weaned to off and his
neurologic status was re-evaluated with no clinical change.  He
demonstrated significant autonomic with periods of severe
hypertension/tachycardia with alternating hypotension.  He also
had [**Location (un) **] respirations with hyperventilation leading to a
primary respiratory alkalosis.  At this point his family
expressed his (and their wishes) to ony pursue aggressive
measures if he was sure to have a good neurologic outcome.
Because of his very poor neurologic prognosis the family met
with the primary team and the neurology attending, discussed the
case in detail and all aggreed that they wanted to withdraw
care.  He was extubated at 6:55pm on [**2141-8-6**] and he died of
respiratory failure a few minutes later.  The family denied
autopsy.

History of Present Illness:
65 yo M with history of pancreatic CA s/p Whipple [**1-/2159**], Afib,
CHF with LVEF 25-30%, and Type II DM who present s/p cardiac
arrest today. He originally presented to hospital as outpatient
for planned [**Year (4 digits) **], which was cancelled due to tachycardia,
relative hypotension, and inability to find oxygen sat. Patient
then left the hospital to go home and had a witnessed Vfib
arrest with intubation in field and epi down ETT. Was shocked
out of Vfib. FS at that time was 132.
.
*per phone conversation with patient's wife*
In last few weeks patient had been complaining to his wife that
he was more short of breath with exertion. Wife reports that
patient acted like he had given up on life as he had no
motivation to do even the smallest thing like change his
underwear. She notes that he was sleeping through most of the
day. Patient also may have been a bit more confusion lately.
Patient finished 6.5 weeks of radiation therapy last week.
Patient has also finished multiple cycles of gemcitabine
chemotherapy. Of note, wife is very angry about the fact that
patient was released to home from GI procedure suite today. She
resports that she feels it was inappropriate to send a
""half-dead"" man home.
.
In the emergency department, vitals at presentation were: T
96.6, HR 112, BP 125/32, and intubated with O2Sat 100%. Patient
had multiple impaging procedures including negative CT head, CT
abd/pelvis showing large simple ascites, CTA chest without PE
but did show multiple right rib fractures and sternal fracture.
Currently being cooled (target reached at 33 C) and on a
midazolam drip. EKG without concern for STEMI, and cardiology
feels this is close to his baseline EKG. Prior to transfer to
the ICU vitals were: T 92 98, HR , BP 101/58, RR 25, O2Sat 100%
on AC mode Vt 560, f 22, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%.

Reports
[**2159-9-27**]
Regular rhythm at 97 beats per minute. In leads V5-V6 there are
P waves so
this is probably sinus rhythm at 97 beats per minute. Marked low
voltage in the limb leads persists. The right bundle-branch
block pattern persists with a QRS duration which has widened to
158 milliseconds. There is poor R wave progression laterally and
low voltage in all leads. There are small Q waves in leads II,
III and aVF with ST segment elevation in those leads. Consider
acute inferior myocardial infarction.
.
[**9-27**] CT head w/o Contrast
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
[**2159-9-27**] Chest CT w contrast
. No central PE or dissection. Suboptimal evaluation of the
posterior
pulmonary circulation secondary to large bilateral pleural
effusions with
associated compressive atelectasis.
2. Focal small foci of gas in the anterior upper abdomen on the
last image of
non-contrast sequence. Free air cannot be excluded.
3. Large amount of abdominal ascites.
4. Multiple right and left rib fractures and a sternal fracture.
These may be
related to recent resuscitative efforts.
5. Ground-glass opacity in the right middle lobe may be a
pulmonary contusion
versus infection versus aspiration. This is new since [**2159-7-19**].

.
CT abdomen
Large volume ascites with no evidence of free air..
.
ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and hypokinesis
of the remaining segments. The anterior septum contracts best
(LVEF 25-30%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The estimated cardiac index is depressed
(<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-4-25**], the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now highter.
.
[**9-29**] CXR
Cardiomegaly, large bilateral pleural effusions greater on the
right side with
associated atelectases are unchanged. ET tube, NG tube, and
right central
catheter remain in place. There is no pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo M with history of pancreatic CA s/p Whipple [**1-/2159**], Afib,
CHF with LVEF 25-30%, and Type II DM who present s/p cardiac
arrest today. Is being cooled with Artic Sun.



#. Vfib cardiac arrest:
Most likely etiology was either new ischemia or automaticity
from old scar in setting of dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy with
LVEF of 25-30%. Patient's exam and history was consistent with
decompensated heart failure of at least several week duration.
Less likely cause of cardiac arrest would be digoxin toxicity
given patient recently started that medication and has history
of renal insufficiency. CTA chest was overall a poor study given
large pleural effusions, though no apparent PE or aortic
dissection. Patient fortunately had relatively rapid
defibrillation and [**Name (NI) **] during code. He was being cooled
followed by warmed on Artic Sun for neuro protection and has
reached temperature goal of 33 C.  48hr EEG showed possible
seizure activity consistent with ischemic injury; consult neuro
to evaluate EEG
Family meeting once warmed and off sedation to discuss goals of
care and prognosis, and it was decided to enact comfort care
measures.
.
#Hypotension: likely secondary to worsening heart failure in the
setting of fluid overload. N.epi and vasopressin as needed for

setting of arrest



Mr [**Known lastname 4017**] wife and son decided they wanted to fully withdraw
care. Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] met with them and answered all questions - pt was
extubated and all pressors were  turned off. Placed on Morphine
for comfort. At approx. 12:45PM, I was notified by the nurse the
patient had passed away with his family at bedside.

.
[**2159-9-30**]
I examined the patient and he was not responsive to auditory or
tactile stimuli. I observed 1 minute of no breaths or
respiratory effort. I auscultated no breath sounds or heart
sounds for 1 minute. The patient did not have a corneal reflex
or pupilllary reaction to direct light bilaterally. I declared
the patient dead at 12:57 PM and notified his family who were in
the hallway outside the ICU.  His wife and son denied a autopsy.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p asystolic/PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation [**2192-3-18**]

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 69 year old female with history of HTN and mild
dementia who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] s/p witnessed
arrest. Per report the patient was noted to have altered mental
status today. She was experiencing increasing hip pain over last
few months as well as increased forgetfullness and tremor. This
a.m. the patient did not appear well to family, was screaming
and acting not herself. After a meal the patient appeared
somnolent and lethargic, then became unresponsive for which EMS
was called. ROS revealed increasing dyspnea on exertion and
orthopnea without change in weight. No N/V recently, ROS
otherwise negative.
.
At approximately 3:52 PM today the patient was noted to have an
arrest for which her family called 911. CPR was initiated by BLS
approximately 10 minutes after she was down. Initial rhythm was
asystole, for which the patient was not shocked. After 10
minutes of CPR, ALS arrived with rhythm monitoring revealing for
PEA. The patient received 1 round epinephrine and atropine with
return of pulse. The patient was intubated in the field.
.
The patient was brought to [**Hospital6 3105**] where her
K+ was noted to be 7.1, chloride 88, bicarb 35. Initial cardiac
enzymes were negative and WBC 11.6, Hct 49.2, plt 193. LFTS with
AST 717, ALT 1021 with nl INR. Initial ABG showed
7.14/92.9/123.7 (5:20 PM), with repeat 7.28/77/65 at 6:30 PM
after intubation. CT noted small L ptx on chest ct with
nondisplaced rib fractures, encasement of R&L mainstem bronchi
and consolidations in RLL, LLL, and RUL.
.
In ED, initial vitals showed:
A RIJ was placed as was an arterial line. The patient was
initially paralyzed with plan for Arctic sun which was then
aborted given duration of time after arrest. Repeat CXR did not
reveal pneumothorax but reported what was interpreted as
bilateral interstitial edema. Head CT showed no acute
intracranial pathology. The patient received Ca, insulin,
bicarb, kayexlate X2 with K 4.7. Transaminases in 900s-1000s,
LDH 1300. Cardiology consulted in ED and did not believe arrest
[**1-28**] coronary event.

hyperkalemia, given extensive multiorgan damage, pt to be made
CMO by family.
.
# Resp failure: Unclear etiology, ?ARDS, likely due to possible
aspiration pna. We initially maintained pt on the ventilator &
continued antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia. Pt was
made CMO by family.
.
# s/p PEA arrest: reported 10 minutes prior to initiation of
CPR; etiology of arrest unclear resp.arrest vs. hyperkalemia.
Neurologic recovery guarded, pt was found to be in non
convulsive status on EKG; anti-epileptic meds started. Treated
pt with broad spectrum antibiotics. Pt was made comfort measures
by family given pt overall poor prognosis.
.
# Nonconvulsive epilepticus: Neurology was consulted given pt
intermittent twitching and she was found to be in non-convulsive
status. Appreciated neurology recommendations which included
anti-epileptic medications. Pt was eventually made comfort
measures by family members.
.
# Hyperkalemia, now resolved: Unclear etiology. As above, most
likely secondary to acidemia from arrest. Pt was made comfort
care by family members.
.
# ?Lung mass: CT from OSH concerning for encasement of pulmonary
arteries. Unclear what soft tissue density is at this point, no
evidence of pathological masses.
.
# Leukocytosis: UA Negative, treated with antibiotics for
possible aspiration & community acquired pneumonia.
.
# Transaminitis: Most likely related to arrest with resultant
ischemic hepatitis however consider other primary etiologies as
well.
.
# Goals of care: After further discussion with family given
medical condition of pt, she was made comfort measures. No
further labs, tests were done.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74283**] is a 46 year old male with past medical history
notable for dilated alcoholic cardiomyopathy who presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] after a witnessed arrest at home earlier on the day of
admission. The patient went to see his usual cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 11850**], at [**Hospital6 **] in the early afternoon.
After his appointment, he went to his brother's house where he
was noted to be intoxicated and c/o shortness of breath. The
patient's brother then noted that he ""gurgled"" for about one
minute while making a grunting noise; the patient typically has
pain and did not complain of any chest pain, back pain, or
palpitations/dizziness at the time per the patient's brother.
The patient ""passed out,"" and the patient's brother initiated
CPR while EMS was called.

On EMS arrival, the patient was shocked X 1 with AED (rhythm not
documented). He then had bradycardic PEA and received a total of
3 mg epi and 2 mg atropine. He regained a rhythm with rapid a
fib. The CPR appears to have lasted about 25 minutes total. The
patient was intubated in the field and taken to [**Hospital 31145**]. At [**Hospital3 4298**] he received lopressor 5
mg IV X 2. At that point, his BPs dropped to 60/40 and he was
placed on dopamine with recovery of pressures in to the 90s
systolic.

Labs at OSH revealed K 4.1, creatinine 0.9, WBC 11.5, Hct 48,
Plt 226. ABG showed 7.32, pCO2 30, pO2 307, FiO2 100%, He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **]; en route, dopamine was
turned off and patient was switched to levophed on arrival here.
A right femoral line was placed in the ED.

On arrival to the floor, the patient was on levophed which was
switched back to dopamine. An a line was placed in the left
radial artery.

ROS: Unable to obtain as patient was sedated & intubated.

Pertinent Results:
EKG from OSH demonstrated atrial fibrillation at a rate of 90.
Normal axis. Flipped T waves in V5-6. T waves biphasic in V4. ST
segments < 0.5 mm depressed in V6.

EKG here: atrial fibrillation at rate of 80. normal axis.
flipped t waves v4-6. no st segment changes noted.

TELEMETRY demonstrated: atrial fibrillation
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2196-11-29**] demonstrated: dilated LV
(66 mm ed and 57 mm es), EF 25%, mild MR, dilated LA, LV
systolic function severely impaired with diffuse LV hypokinesis
and symmetric LVH, mild TR, RV systolic pressure 41
* Previous echo ([**12/2196**]) with EF 52%

TTE [**2197-5-27**]:  LV cavity severely dilated with severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). moderately dilated RV cavity. moderate
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. no AR. mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR [**5-26**]: profound cardiomegaly, likely fluid overload
CXR [**6-2**]: Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette is unchanged. Left pleural effusion if any is small,
without increase. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
mediastinal venous engorgement persist.

EEG [**5-28**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the
frequent left more than right frontal spike or sharp and slow
wave discharges as well as the slow and disorganized background
rhythm. These are suggestive of bilateral frontal potential foci
of epileptogenesis. The slow and
disorganized background rhythm is suggestive of a mild to
moderate
encephalopathy which may be seen with medication effect, toxic
metabolic
abnormalities, infections, or global ischemic injury. There were
no
electrographic seizures noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 46yoM with a PMH of HTN, DMII, chronic afib, alcoholism,
and EtOH cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%) with PEA/cardiac arrest s/p
prolonged resuscitation. Hospital course by problem is as
follows:

#) Arrythmia/arrest: Most likely VT or VF arrest. The etiology
for arrest is uncertain. MI was unlikely given relatively small
size of CE elevation. Rise in CEs were likely secondary to
prolonged resuscitation and multiple shocks. Electrolyte
abnormality unlikely given stable lytes at presentation to OSH.
Most likely, arrest was precipitated by fluid overload in the
setting of medication noncompliance (patient reportedly was not
taking meds for a few days prior) and ETOH binge.

The patient remained in atrial fibrillation upon admission and
had episodes of tachycardia,(as high as 160s, and sustained in
130s) so esmolol drip was intiated for HR control (goal 90-110)
but discontinued shortly thereafter due to hypotension.  On [**5-27**]
the patient was started on amiodarone to prevent arrhythmias;
however, cardioversion x 5 was done in attempt to convert the
patient back to sinus rhythm. This was achieved only briefly
(<30seconds) and 2 attempts were repeated again on [**5-28**] but were
not successful. Amiodarone was restarted until [**5-30**] when the team
opted for rate control via metoprolol instead. The patient was
maintained on heparin gtt for anticoagulation.

#) Cardiac/ pump: Patient was initially started on levophed to
maintain BP after hypotension occurring during resuscitation
([**12-30**] lopressor administration), but was then started on dopamine
drip that was weaned off. Patient presented with evidence of CHF
and fluid overload on exam - rales on PE and pulmonary edema on
CXR. A subsequent TTE showed an EF 20-25%. The patient was
aggressively diuresed with milrinone (weaned off) and lasix to a
total of negative 6.5L, guided by swan-ganz catheterization.
Digoxin and captopril were started to maximize hemodynamic
status.

#) Anoxic brain injury: on HD1 pt began displaying myoclonic
jerking in all 4 extremities. Etiology was unknown, and presumed
to be related to anoxic brain injury, as glucose was slightly
elevated, electrolytes slightly below nml, but degree of change
would not explain new onset seizures. Toxicology screen at OSH
was negative. The neurology service was consulted and a CT
head/c spine was done to rule out intracranial or cervical
injury. A hard trauma collar was placed per neuro (concern for c
spine injury). Seizures/myoclonus were controlled with versed
and fentanyl boluses and prn ativan to treat for concurrent EtOH
withdrawal. Seizures resolved with these measures, but on [**5-30**]
began to recurr. EEG was inconclusive, and the patient was
started on keppra. On [**6-1**] the patient began experiencing more
episodes of myoclonus with hypertension (~200/100s),
tachycardia, and tachypnea associated with myoclonus. He was
started on propofol for sedation, with good relief of these
signs, however by [**6-2**], neurology determined that chances of
neurological recovery were poor, and a family meeting was held
as discussed below.

#) EtoHism: Because of the patient's history of alcoholism,
thiamine/ folate supplementation were started on admission.
versed was used initially to prevent withdrawal (pt's EtOH level
was 138 from OSH), however, this was held per neurology's
recommendation so that an adequate neurological assessment could
be done. The patient was monitored closely for the development
of DTs.

#) Fever/ leukocytosis: The patient presented with low grade
fever (100.0) and leukocytosis (11.5) which progressed
throughout hospital stay to tmax of 102.4 on [**5-29**]. clinical
suspicion was for sinusitis versus PNA ([**5-27**] sputum sample
positive for 4+GPR, 2+GPC; ?LLL opacity on CXR) versus line
infection (swan tip culture negative to date). Blood cultures
and urine cultures returned negative to date. Vancomycin was
started on HD4 and zosyn was added on HD5 for empiric treatment.
The patient did not respond to treatment and it was thought the
the etiology of fevers may be central (secondary to anoxic brain
injury).

#) Respiratory status: The patient was intubated by EMS and was
maintained on ventilation with assist control with Tv 600, RR
14, weaning FiO2 as tolerated. On [**5-30**] the patient was briefly
tried on PS, but failed.

#) DM: outpatient meds were held; DM was managed with an ISS.

#) During his hospital course the pt was maintained on tube
feeds with a ppi, heparin gtt, and bowel regimen for
prophylaxis.

#) Patient's code status was initially FULL, but given his poor
prognosis, lack of recovery and the low likelihood of any
meaningful neurological recovery, a family meeting was held on
[**2197-6-2**] and his family decided to change his status to comfort
measures only. He was extubated at 1pm and expired within a few
hours after extubation. As per his mother's request, his
brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 74283**] was notified of the death.

[**2170-11-19**] - Central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 y/o F with unknown PMHx who is being
admitted to the CCU after a witnessed cardiac arrest in an OSH
ED. Per report, the patient called 911 this morning after
developing acute-onset SOB at home this morning. She was noted
to be hypoxic (O2 sat 70's to 80's on CPAP) and was brought to
[**Hospital3 **] ED. Shortly after arriving in the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she
had a witnessed cardiac arrest. Initial rhythm was PEA;
immediately prior to arrest, rhythm had been SR with prolonged
PR followed by slow Afib. During the arrest, she received 2 of
epi and 1 of atropine, with change of rhythm to Vfib. She then
received 2 more of epi, 1 of bicarb, 10 units IV insulin, and 2
shocks, with ROSC. Rhythm at that time was Afib with RVR. She
was intubated and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. She was
then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management. Of
note, she was also started on a diltiazem gtt for afib/rvr,
which was stopped on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]. Prior to transfer, she
did exhibit some agitation and attempted to pull her ETT, for
which she was given 3 mg ativan.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, ECG showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of
110's, no evidence of acute ischemia. The patient was placed on
fentanyl and versed for sedation. She was evaluated by
cardiology and bedside echo was performed. Given ? evidence of
right heart strain on echo, there was high suspicion for PE as
the etiology of the patient's arrest. She was empirically
started on heparin gtt. Given concern for potential infiltrate
on CXR, she was also empirically started on CTX/azithro. She was
difficult to ventilate [**12-27**] dyssynchrony. CVL was placed and the
patient was started on levophed to allow for increased sedation.
She underwent CTA chest prior to transfer to the CCU.

On arrival to the CCU, the patient was intubated and sedated,
making further history unable to be obtained. Review of systems
was unable to be obtained.

Imaging:
-CXR ([**2170-11-19**]):
1. Endotracheal tube in standard position. No pneumothorax.
2. Multifocal opacities, most severe in the right upper lung,
concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
.
-CTA chest ([**2170-11-19**]):
Emboli within both right and left pulmonary arteries at the
segemental level. Associated scattered peripheral airspace
opacities likely reflect pulmonary infarction in the setting of
PE, however, infection cannot be excluded.
.
-TTE ([**2170-11-19**]):
The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with severe systolic
dysfunction. Small left ventricle with normal global and
regional systolic dysfunction. Unable to estimate pulmonary
pressures on this study.
.
-LENIs ([**2170-11-20**]):
No DVT; bilateral [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.
.
- CT head noncontrast ([**11-22**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process with no evidence of hemorrhage
or mass.
2. No CT evidence of global hypoperfusion, though MRI would have
increased
sensitivity for early associated changes and can be obtained as
clinically
indicated.
3. Dilation of the bilateral right greater than left superior
ophthalmic
veins, which can be seen in the setting of carotid cavernous
fistula.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o F with dementia and h/o VTE (not on anticoagulation at
admission) who was admitted to the CCU after a witnessed PEA
arrest in an OSH ED, with ROSC, now found to have bilateral PE's
on CT imaging.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# PEA ARREST: The patient is s/p witnessed cardiac arrest in OSH
ED (PEA -> Vfib) with ROSC. She was intubated, paralyzed,
sedated and therapeutic hypothermia protocol was initiated at
11AM on [**2170-11-19**] prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. The etiology of the
patient's arrest is most likely bilateral PE's, which were seen
on CTA imaging. She was started on a heparin gtt.  Other
etiologies which were considered include ischemia, electrolyte
abnormalities. Trop peaked at 0.67, however she received chest
compression and defibrillation prior to transfer, which could
elevate her biomarkers.  There were no EKG changes to suggest
ischemia and ACS was not though to be the cause of her arrest.
She was initially started on norepinephrine and phenylepherine
to maintain her MAP >60, phenylepherine was subsequently changed
to vasopressin.  Initially, she was noted to have a significant
metabolic acidosis with arterial pH <7.2.  She received 1amp of
bicarb followed by 1L of normal bicarbonate with improvement in
her acidemia.  Her lactate peaked at 5.3 and subsequently
trended down.
.
# Bilateral PE's: She has a history of DVT according to her PCP
who was [**Name (NI) 653**] during this admission.  She was not on
anticoagulation at the time of admission, prior DVT was in the
setting of leg injury. As above, this is the likely etiology of
the patient's PEA arrest. She did not receive thrombolysis
because she was stable on 2 pressors at the time of arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**], the risk was thought to outweigh the potential benefit.
LENIs showed no DVT in her legs.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Her initial rhythm after ROSC was atrial
fibrillation with RVR.  She was briefly started on a dilt gtt,
which was stopped when she became increasingly hypotensive.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was intermittently between sinus
rhythm and Afib.  She does not have a known history of Afib and
this was likely related to myocardial strain in the setting of
acute PE.
.
# Elevated Cr: Cr was 1.3 on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]. Unclear
baseline, but her creatinine improved to 1.0 after fluid
resuscitation.  Likely pre-renal from volume depletion and poor
forward flow during her PEA arrest.
.
# Dementia: On Aricept and Namenda at home, these were held in
the setting of sedation during intubation and hypothermia.
.
# Goal of care: Pt has code status of DNR/DNI as confirmed with
family after she was resuscitated and intubated at the OSH.  The
family did not want to escalate care should her condition
worsen.  The discussion around goal of care was continued
throughout the hospitalization.  On [**11-22**], pt's family decided
that comfort measure only was in compliance with pt's best
interest given her current condition and prior wishes.
.
# End of life: At 04:33 Am on [**2170-11-23**], the housestaff was paged
to come to the bedside of this patient who was found
unresponsive and not breathing.  She was unresponsive to voice,
sternal pressure or supraorbital pressure.  Breath sounds were
absent.  Heart sounds and pulses were absent.  Pupillary
reflexes were absent.  She was pronounced dead at 4:35 AM.
Patient's next [**Doctor First Name **] and son, [**Name (NI) 2855**] [**Name (NI) 10269**] and other family
members present at the bedside.  Immediate cause of death was
cardiorespiratory arrest.  Chief cause of death was pulmonary
embolism.  Other antecedent causes include atrial fibrillation
and dementia.

(EF 25-30%), CAFib, and HTN who was found down at Rehab with VT.
Per report, she was doing well at [**Hospital 392**] Rehab until yesterday
8:15 PM when she was found minimally responsive in the toilet
without signs of trauma. To minutes afterwards became
unresponsive, without pulse and without breathing in front of
nursing staff. They started CPR immediately and placed AED that
shocked her twice (120 J and 150 J respectively). EMS arrived
and per their report she was in sinus rhythm with ventricular
ectopy. She had a pulse and was breathing. She received 100 mg
lidocaine IV bolus. She was transfered to [**Hospital3 5365**]. Her
initial BP was ~70/40 mmHg and no neurologic exam or [**Location (un) 2611**] is
documented. She was intubated for ""airway protection"" with
Propofol, etomidate and succynilcoline and BP dropped afterwards
and dopamine was started.
.
Initial labs showed: K of 7.5, creatinine of 3.38, Na 132, WBC
of 15.9 with left shift, PLT 246, CK 38, MB 2.3, TNT 0.05. Other
labs included: PT 14, INR 1.4, BUN 66, Ca 8.3, AST 52, ALT 39,
TP 5.3, Albumin 2.9, Globulin 2.4, AP 162. Her ECG showed sinus
rhythm with LBBB unchanged from prior here on [**11-14**]. She
received kayexalate, insulin, calcium gluconate and was
transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
In the BIDMCs ER VS were T 97.7, HR 81, BP 104/46, RR 19, SpO2

There is interval development of hypodense appearance of the
cerebral
parenchyma on the right side diffusely, in the right frontal,
parietal and
temporal lobes predominantly, with sulcal effacement and loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation. Findings can relate to acute
infarction or
hypoxic/anoxic/ischemic injury Evaluation of basal ganglia,
brain stem and
posterior fossa structures is limited, as also evidence for
herniation. No
acute gross hemorrhage is noted. Study significantly limited due
to artifacts from the electrodes. Consider repeating after
removal of electrodes, if appropriate and correlate clinically.
Evaluation for associated infection is limited

KUB [**12-31**]
An NG tube has been advanced, and is
likely within distal stomach. There has been a decrease in
distension of a
loop of bowel within the mid abdomen, now measuring
approximately 4.5 cm
(previously 5.5 cm). This likely reflects a small bowel loop
rather than
colon. There is no free air or pneumatosis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval improvement in a dilated loop of bowel in the mid
abdomen, likely reflecting small bowel.
2. NG tube tip in distal stomach.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 2270**] [**Known lastname 100793**] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman
with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent [**Last Name (un) 7792**] in [**11-4**], HTN,
sCHF (EF 25-30%) who had VT arrest in rehab. She was transferred
to CCU, received Arctic Sun protocol but never regained cortical
function. She passed on [**2131-1-2**]
.
# Anoxic Brain Injury, R MCA CVA - patient never regained
cortical function after neurologic insult prior to admission.
EEG showed diffuse brain dysfunction. Repeat CTs showed massive
CVA. Serial neuro exams were concerning for brain death. Given
prognosis, family communicated that patient would rather pass
than ""live as a vegetable"". A decision was made to slowly
withdraw care. Roughly 20 family members were at the bedside in
her final days.
.
#. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely
VF/VT arrest secondarely to ischemia after his [**Date Range 7792**]. Never
clear how long she was pulseless. There was suggestion of focal
neurologic deficits in ED, CT negative. Artic sun protocol
completed and repeat CT showed R MCA CVA. While her cardiac
status was stable in a LBBB pattern, she had permanent and
terminal damage
.
#. Hypotension/Septic Shock - most likely in the setting of
starting mechanical ventilation and with sedation. Patient also
dehydrated given diarrhea at rehab. Had + U/A on admission. On
rewarming, she required more pressors. Ultimately, she had C.
Diff colitis complicated by sepsis and renal failure. She was on
PO Vanc and IV flagyl until care was withdrawn
.
#. Acute Renal Failure (ATN)
# Acute on Chronic kidney disease - Patient with diarrhea at
home, poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone who comes
with worsening of the creatinine. She ultimately had anuric
renal failure likely [**1-29**] to sepsis and c diff
.
# Complicated C Diff Colitis, - had diarrhea at rehab and after
cooling was stopped, became septic and KUB showed dilated bowel
(likely small). Patient was on PO Vanc and IV flagyl until care
withdrawn

# Peripheral Vascular Disease: Patient admitted with dopplerable
dorsalis pedis pulses. During septic shock, those pulses became
undetectable. By the time of death, her feet were cyanotic and
black on the toes.

.
The patient's mother and sister report that the patient has a
long history of substance abuse. He has a history of significant
EtOH abuse with DT's and more recently prescription drug abuse
including benzodiazepines. The patient has been acting odd by
family report since [**2111-7-22**]. There is high concern for
substance abuse. The patient was not known to be suicidal. On
the morning of admission, the patient was seen by his mother at
his home and was noted to be ""in a haze"" acting as if ""in a
stupor."" Later in the day the patient's mother found him asleep
in bed and over many minutes was noted to have poor breathing.
EMS was called and the he was thought to be in asystole vs. VF
and received epinephrine and atropine x3 followed by
cardioversion with return to sinus rhythm. The patient was
intubated and sedated in the field and brought to [**Hospital **]
Hospital prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**]. There was concern
for intentional overdose as a cause of his arrest however tox
screen was notable only for EtOH level in the 200's at the OSH.
In the ED the patient was initiated on a cooling protocol. CXR
revealed left-sided retrocardiac opacity concerning for
aspiration and in light of leukocytosis, the patient was started
on levofloxacin and metronidazole for antibiotic coverage.

[**2112-11-30**] EEG:
Abnormal portable EEG due to the widespread monotonous
alpha background. This suggests medication effect as the most
common
cause of such records. There were no areas of prominent focal
slowing,
and there were no epileptiform features.

[**2112-12-5**] EEG
This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the low voltage,
disorganized and poorly modulated background, consisting mainly
of a
faster beta frequency rhythm, likely reflecting medication
effects from
benzodiazepine or barbiturate administration. Findings are
consistent
with a moderate encephalopathy, suggestive of dysfunction of
bilateral
subcortical or deep midline structures. Medications, metabolic
disturbances, infection, and anoxia are among the common causes
of
encephalopathy. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing.
Several episodes of lower extremity tremulousness were noted by
the EEG
technician; no associated epileptiform features were noted. No
electrographic seizure activity was noted.

[**2112-2-6**] MRI Brain:
1.  Low ADC is identified in the white matter of
parietooccipital lobes and temporal lobes, suspicious for a
hypoxic injury.
2.  The exact nature of the increased signal identified in the
basal ganglia on ADC map and FLAIR is unclear but could be also
due to hypoxic injury.
3.  Enhancement along the sulci and also in the basal ganglia
region could be secondary to meningitis or meningeal
inflammation from other causes.  Clinical correlation is
recommended.
4.  Extensive paranasal sinus changes as described above.

Brief Hospital Course:
CARDIAC ARREST:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14887**] is a 49 yo M with a history of EtOH and prescription
drug abuse, who was found unresponsive at home by his mother.
EMS was called and thought Mr. [**Known lastname 14887**] was in VF asystole vs. VF
and received epinephrine and atropine x3 followed by
cardioversion with return to sinus rhythm. The patient was
intubated and sedated in the field and brought to [**Hospital **]
Hospital prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. There was concern for
intentional overdose as a cause of his arrest; however, tox
screen was notable only for EtOH level in the 200's at the OSH.
TSH was normal.  CXR revealed left-sided retrocardiac opacity
concerning for aspiration and in light of leukocytosis, the
patient was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole for
antibiotic coverage.  It is likely that hypoxia, possibly from
the aspiration, led to a cardiac arrest.  He was also found to
be hypokalemic on admission, which may have also contributed to
cardiac arrest.

ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:
In the ED the patient was initiated on a cooling protocol.
Neurology was consulted to advise on prognosis, but his acute
febrile illness made it difficult to prognosticate long-term
function from the cardiac arrest. He remained intubated and
sedated on propofol from admission to [**2112-12-7**], at which point
his sedation was changed to fentanyl/versed.

EEG on [**2112-1-31**] revealed widespread monotomous slowing with no
areas of prominent focal slowing; there were also no
epileptiform features.  Repeat EEG was later performed on
[**2112-2-5**] because of concern that the patient may have been in
status epilepticus after he was noted to have rhythmic shaking
movements from his toes to his face.  It did not show epileptic
activity and was unchanged from the prior EEG. Ultimately, it
was felt that his movements were tremors, possibly the result of
his brain stem injury.

Mr. [**Known lastname 14887**] made no progress neurologically and remained
ventillator dependent.  In light of this, and his peristent
fevers and leikocytosis (see below) he was made CMO on [**2112-2-9**]
and extubated on [**2112-2-10**].  He expired on [**2112-2-11**].

PNEUMONIA and RESPIRATORY FAILURE
Sputum cultures from early in the admission grew out MSSA, and
he was treated with several rounds of broad spectrum
antibiotics.  Patient continued to require ventilator support,
so he was made CMO on [**2112-2-9**] and extubated on [**2112-2-10**]

PERSISTENT FEVERS AND LEUKOCYTOSIS:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14887**] had positive sputum cultures from his MSSA pneumonia.
He also had blood cultures showing GPCs in pairs and clusters.
His high fevers and elevated WBC persisted despite several
rounds of antibiotics. He had an LP on [**2112-2-6**], with an opening
pressure of 40 but otherwise normal. His abdomen was also noted
to be tense, and he developed diarrhea, but tested negative for
C.diff twice and had a C.diff toxin B pending. He likely had a
central component to his persistent fevers. He had no evidence
of a drug reaction, and never developed any rash or
eosinophilia.

ETOH WITHDRAWAL
The patient was monitored for EtOH withdrawal when intubated,
but he had no signs of withdrawal and required no
benzodiazepines for treatment.  He was given thiamine, folate
and a banana bag.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 50 year old man with history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF 10%), afib, DM2, obesity presenting after
being found down on [**2174-8-18**]. EMS found him to be in afib with
RVR (120s) and in respiratory distress. He was intubated for
airway protection and brought to OSH.  RIJ placed and started on
dopamine gtt for hypotension and sedated with versed.  EKG
showed a.fibb with RVR, Peak troponin 0.56.

Initial workup at the OSH showed an elevated BNP of 310,
elevated WBC to 14. He did spike a temp to 101 and was started
on vancomycin and imipenem after blood and urine cultures
obtained.   He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU.

CCU course: Pt was weaned off dopamine and antibiotics were
changed to vanco and zosyn for suspected pneumonia.  ECHO done
showed stable cardiomyopathy (EF 10%) and CXR with infrahilar
opacification.  Sputum cultures grew proteums with GS + GPC
(pairs/clusters), GPR and GN diploccci.  Pt was persistently
febrile despite vanc/zosyn and thus ID called.

Pulmonary also consulted and underwent BAL.  BAL showed viral
inclusions on cytology.

# RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious
standpoint, multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, cultures
postitive on [**8-18**] as listed above, then on [**8-25**] positive HSV1 on
BAL. Sputum positive for MSSA. However, pt also has severe CHF
(EF 10%). Pt remained intubated and unable to wean from vent. Pt
felt to be severely volume overloaded and wt as droped over 30
kg since coming to CCU. He was aggressively diuresed, first with
bolus lasix, escalating to lasix gtt @ 20mg/hr and metalazone,
and diamox.  The process was complicated by hyponatremia
requiring frequent free water balances. On [**9-5**] pt underwent
trach and PEG. By [**9-10**] it was believed that we have overdiuresed
the pt, Cr increaseing, BP dropping and fluid resesitant was
began. Fluid status remains a challange to assess given the pt
body habitus. The pt's habitus also contributes to the resp
distress and he becomes tachypnic and hypotensive when laying
flat. Pt often has chennes [**Doctor Last Name 6056**] repiration with RR in 40s and
periods of apnea. Does better on vent settings as follows:
Vt600/rate24/peep10/fi0240%. Pt thought to be dry thus lasix was
held. He was continued on atrovent nebs prn. [**9-8**] sputum showed
MSSA, therefore vanco was d/c'ed. Had added flagyl for concern
of aspiration pna. As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, follwoing clinda
sensitivities, clinda was d/c'd on [**2174-9-11**]. Antibiotics switched
to Ceftazidime 1gm Q12H on [**2174-9-11**]. Pt completed 14 day course
of antibiotics and they were d/c'd. Patient subsequently
developed higher fevers and was re-started on vanc/zosyn on
[**2174-9-19**] per ID recs. On [**9-21**], in the setting of worsening
respiratory status with metabolic acidosis, fever, tachycardia,
and hypotension, it was decided that antibiotics were not
helping and all were d/c'ed. His breaths became markedly
irregular and agonal, with short, gasping inhalations. Discussed
pt's situation with his brother and his fiancee (in person) and
with his other borhter (on the phone) and it was decided on [**9-21**], [**2174**] to make Mr. [**Known lastname 5395**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] measures only.  He was
pronounced dead at 20:[**2086-9-15**] from respiratory failure
secondary to pneumonia and CHF>

# FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
Despite finishing course of abx cefepime, levofloxacin, flagyl
for [**8-18**] positive cultures, pt continued to spike fevers. The
WBC remained stable, sputum cultures + for pan-sensitive
proteus, urine legionella Ag neg, sputum legionella cx neg to
date, CT/CXR with b/l lower lobe consolidations. RIJ cath tip
neg. Ucx to date neg. Tib/Fib film no evidence of osteomyelitis.
TEE w/o evidence of endocarditis. The source of fevers remained
unclear. On [**8-25**] Initial cytology from BAL showing HSV
inclusions and HSV1 culture positive. Completed coarse of
Acyclovir 1000mg IV q8h
but continued to spike fevers up to 102. A [**9-7**] WBC scan [**Last Name (un) **]
only minor chest wall focus with no major chest or abd finding.
HIV negative.  On [**9-11**] culture + MSSA in sputum and +
pseudomonas in urine, and fever increased to 104. Now on Ceftaz,
flagyl and nafcillin (first dose [**2174-9-13**]).  BP remains low, HR
high, febrile, unclear at this time if picture is septic or
cardiogenic shock. On [**9-19**] pt spiked fever to 103.1, which was
higher than the fevers that he had previously been spiking
frequently. On [**9-20**] his fevers climbed to 104.5 despite
continued q6h tylenol. They remained unexplained; LUQ ultrasound
showed no evidence of abscess near PEG tube site, TEE had no
vegetations, chest/abdomen/pelvis CT showed no abscess or other
concerning intrabdominal process. Thus, in a final attempt to
bring his fevers down a triple lumen foley catheter was placed
for bladder lavage with cooling liquids, ice cold gastric was
tried, and he was aggressively cooled by the Arctic Sun
protocol. Despite this, his temperature rose to 106.9 so after a
6 hour trial these measures were d/c'ed. On day of death, max
temp was 107.1 F.

# HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%. Volume status
difficult to access, have been aggressively diureising. Very
resistant to lopressor. Had tolerated Captopril, but now held in
setting of low BP and rising Cr. Currently on dig as well. Pt
currently not tolerating PO in setting of  ileus,  thus will
give IV Metoprolol until PO can be resumed. Continue Digoxin at
current dose once PO intake can be resumed.  BB Changed from
Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart when
tolerating PO. Cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for
now given recent oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in
near future.  Given 5% risk of event per year and limit expected
pt lifespan, do not feel strongly on starting heparin.
throughout course patient was extremely dependent on CO. When HR
increased because of fever or tachyarrythmia uop would
subsequently and reliably drop. Patient was started on pressors
for inotropy with good effect on his CO and uop. By [**9-20**], in the
setting of marked fever and metabolic acidosis pt was
tachycardic and hypotensive despite maximum dose of
norepinephrine (0.45 mcg/kg/min). Carvedilol was d/c'ed.
Throughout [**9-21**], pt's SBP remained low with SBP consistently in
50s.

#GI:
PEG in place for fear of poor PO intake with trach. Pt had large
bilious return from PEG tube/ET tube and an ileus on CT that
resolved after TF were held. TF were subsequently re-started
with no further ileus. On [**9-19**] some concern was raised over the
possibility of a peg site infection so a abdominal u/s was
ordered, but was unrevealing. Surgery commented that they felt
the oozing secretions around the PEG tube site was only leaking
tube feeds. Abdominal CT on [**9-20**] showed dilated bowel loops
concerning for c. difficile colitis, but no obstruction or
abscess.

# RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Likely
pre-renal [**3-5**] severe CHF. Cr improved with diuresis and then
began to creep back up with max 3.4 on [**2174-9-13**]. Believe now
intravascularly dry [**3-5**] intense diuresis. FeNa suggestive of
pre-renal etiology. Renal following. Renally dosed meds. Giving
fluid boluses and monitoring UOP, which was noted to be
exquisitely sensitive to blood pressure. Urine output and Cr
improved by [**9-19**], however by [**9-21**], in the setting of very high
fevers and hypotension his urine output dropped to zero for
multiple hours.

# Metabolic Alkalosis
pH up to 7.6 on [**9-12**]. Originally attributed to contraction
alkalosis [**3-5**] aggressive lasix diuresis. However, met alk
continues dispite lack of further diuresis. Thought be be [**3-5**] to
GI losses with large NG output. Aggressively giving KCL today
and continue Diamox.  TTKG calculated [**9-12**] = 12.7, suggesting
renal K loss. Pt was aggressively given KCL, goal K > 4.5.
Alkalosis resolved with hydration.

# DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
Pt becomes aggitated at times, and has managed to pull out an
A-line, and IJ. Stable on Zyprexa

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
Admitted with Afib and RVR. Pt has been poorly responsive to BB.
Also on dig.  Moderate response with IV dilt. Cardiology
consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol.
Anti-coagulation held at first because of coagulopathy and then
re-started with goal INR [**3-6**]. On 8

# COAGULOPATHY
Possible sources since the last coumadin was given on [**8-24**]
include hepatic and nutritional. Hepatic possible given poor CO
and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if
cause was ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible
since no Vit K in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could
be levaquin, as this effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely
since platelets are rising. Held Heparin. Gave Vit K 10mg QD X 3
daysfibrinogen and haptoglobin high so likely not DIC. Resolved.

# Nutrition: PEG inplace, Nutren Renal with benefiber TF at
45mL/hr

# Glycemic Control:  Insulin SS with q6h then q4h checks. Raised
standing NPH to 12U q12H

# Prophylaxis:
DVT: Pneumoboots then heparin SC
Stress ulcer:  Famotidine
VAP: Head of bed elevated.

# Communication:  With brothers and girlfriend.

History of Present Illness:
70 M with hx of Afib, ""leaky valve"" presents with cardiac
arrest.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 88052**] is an active man who has been in his usual state of
health with the exception of [**3-13**] weeks of 'difficulty finishing
sentences'. Today he shovelled snow twice. After the second
shovel session he came into the house and in the subsequent [**2-9**]
hours, calked the front door, paid bills and milled about the
house. He went in to the computer room at the back of the house
and was thereafter out of contact with his wife. His wife was
making dinner and went to ask him a question and found him with
his head tilted back on the chair. She called 911. It was 4pm.
.
Fire arrived first and found him to be in a shockable rhytm. He
was shocked twice. EMS arrived an found him to be in PEA, he
received CPR, epi x 3 and atropine x2. Also calcium, dextrose
and bicarb. One IO's was placed in Left tib.  He was intubated.
.
Taken to AJacques. Arrived at 1655 in, where his presentation BP
was 75/55 with HR 66. Two PIV and additional IO in right Tib
placed. He was started on Dopa 10mcg, then 20. His BP rose to
126/69 with HR 120 at 1704. Neo was started with BP at 147/53.
Given 1L of NS, bicarb and had a ROSC. His WBC was 8.3, his HCT
39.8. An ABG at unknown time was 7.12/53.5/132/17. his pressors
were weaned to neo alone. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he maintained pressures of 130 systolic on neo. Neo
was eventually weaned in the ED. His pupils were fixed
bilaterally. He had an initial trop of 0.07, a WBC of 15.2 and a
lactate of 7.4. EKG with lateral upsloping ST depressions. A CT
of his head found preserved grey-white diff and no ICH. A CT PE
found no PE but did find mediastinal LAD. A right IJ was placed
and he was begun on the arctic sun protocol. He received 1300cc
of IVF and put out 1000 cc by foley. At the time of transfer,
his only infusions were fentanyl and midazolam. his VS were 34.4
112 162/103 26 100% on vent.
.
On review of systems per wife, he denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging / other studies:
.
CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Suboptimal evaluation of subsegmental pulmonary arterial
branches due to patient respiratory motion. No evidence of
central pulmonary embolism. No acute aortic dissection.
2. Right hilar lymphadenopathy.
3. Bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis or
aspiration.
4. Indeterminate 12 mm left adrenal nodule; further workup with
an MRI or
dedicated adrenal CT is recommended if clinically warranted.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Due
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = ~50 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. An eccentric, anteriorly
directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
EEG:
IMPRESSION: This EEG done continuously over 24 hours shows a
severe
encephalopathy manifest by marked suppression with intermittent
bursting
pattern compatible with the cooling protocol itself and sedative

medication. No significant seizure discharges were identified.
.
EKG on admission: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Increased QRS voltage but does not meet criteria for
left ventricular hypertrophy in precordial leads. ST-T wave
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
EKG during admission: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response and increase in rate as compared with previous tracing
of [**2183-2-4**]. The T waves are now biphasic in leads V3-V6 and
there is diffuse ST-T wave flattening in the limb leads. The
anterolateral ST-T change may represent active ischemia.
Followup and clinical correlation are suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
70 year old male M with hx of Afib, ""leaky valve"" presents with
cardiac arrest.
.
# Cardiac Arrest: He was likely pulseless for 45-55 minutes with
CPR for 20-30 minutes; he may have had a shockable rhythm but
degenerated into PEA for the bulk of his arrest. The cause of
his arrest was most likely ischemic, given the wall motion
abnormalities found on echocardiogram and the rising troponins.
The patient was cooled, as described below, and continued to be
in atrial fibrillation while sedated and intubated.
.
# Neuroprotection s/p arrest: Interval between arrest and
initiation of cooling was ~3-4 hours. The Artic Sun therapeutic
cooling protocol was initiated, electrolytes were repleted as
necessary, and a continuous video EEG was taken.  Neurology was
following and reported a poor prognosis for any return of normal
brain function.  A family meeting was held and it was decided to
withdraw care and make the patient CMO.  He passed away shortly
thereafter.
.
# Atrial fibrillation:  The patient's rhythm was controlled with
high-doses of diltiazem QID, after B-blockers were not
sufficient to control his tachycardia. Warfarin was held due to
supratherapeutic levels after cooling and re-warming.  His rapid
ventricular rate may have also been due to an infective process
as described below.
.
#. Staph aureus pneumonia:  As the patient was re-warmed, he
began to show signs of rigoring and he spiked fevers to above 38
degrees celsius.  He was then rewarmed to keep him normothermic,
pan-cultured (blood, urine, sputum), and started on
broad-spectrum antibiotics.  The sputum grew large amounts of
MSSA and the other cultures did not grow anything at the time of
this summary.

central venous catheterization
arterial catheterization

History of Present Illness:
72 year old male with unceratin PMH presents after being found
unresponsive and not breathing at home. Family reported that
patient had been wheezing for the past few days. He saw his PCP
and was given ?abx and inhalers, had CXR on [**10-31**] with extensive
chronic changes with nodular interstitial changes but nothing
acutely seen. He had been heard wheezing in bed this a.m. as
early as 7:30a.m. on morning of admission. Sometime between 8
and 8:30 a.m., he was found by family to be unresponsive, blue,
and not breathing but still warm. EMS was called. He was found
to be in either asystolic or PEA arrest, intubated in field and
coded. He got atropine x 2, Epi x 2 and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
where he receivd more epi/atropine, levoflox, flagyl, 1 amp
calcium gluconate, 10 u insulin, 1 amp D50 and ASA 325 x 1.  He
received CPR both in transport and in the ED. EKG showed diffuse
ST depressions. Given this he was emergently cathed. On arrival
in the cath lab, he was again pulseless and coded. Cath with PA
saturations in the 90's with high PCWP but clean coronaries;
this was likely due to a failure of peripheral/mitochondrial
ability to extract oxygen.  He was on levophed and epinephrine
and intermittently dropping his blood pressures to 50's,
requiring frequent boluses of epinephrine.

At transfer to the ICU, the patient was unresponsive, difficult
to ventilate, in shock, and anuric.  He continued to have
episodes of hypotension requiring boluses of epi every 10 mins.
A subclavin line placed for additional access.

Cardiology Report C.CATH Study Date of [**2142-11-2**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed
no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. The LMCA,
LAD,
LCX, and RCA were all patent with only minimal disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left
sided
pressures (mean RA pressure was 33mmHg, mean PCWP was 36mmHg).
There was
severe pulmonary hypertension (mean PAP was 53mmHg). The cardiac
index
was elevated at 7.4 L/min/m2. No significant gradient across the
aortic
valve was noted up on pullback of the pigtail catheter from the
left
ventricle.
3.  Echocardiography in the lab revealed normal ventricular
function
and no signiicant valvular disease and no pericardial effusion
or
evidence of intracardiac shunt.
4. Severe systemic hypotension to 50 mm Hg systolic responding
to
boluses of epinephrine.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Non-cardiogenic shock.
.
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2142-11-2**]
Conclusions:
At the beginning of this study, left an right ventricular
contractile function
appeared normal to hyperdynamic. At the end of ther study,
during hypotension,
with high dose epinephrine, there was at least moderate global
biventriculart
hypokinesis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2142-11-3**] 11:03 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Swan-Ganz catheter from inferior approach with distal tip in
right ventricle. This finding was relayed in a preliminary
report to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4281**] at 11:45 p.m. on [**2142-11-3**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
2. There is scarring in the right apex and laterally in the left
upper lung. There may be increased density in the left apex,
which may be indicative of a developing pneumonia. Correlate
clinically.
.
Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2142-11-6**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the extremely severe
encephalopathy. No electrographic activity of cerebral origin
was
noted. The usual EEG parameters for brain death protocol were
utilized.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was a 72 yr old male who was admitted after being
found down for an unknown period of time, with full
cardiopulmonary arrest.

He required very aggressive hemodynamic and ventilatory support
during his first days in the ICU.  Once his shock had
stabilized, formal testing revealed brain death.  The clinical
examination was confirmed at different times by three
physicians.  An apnea test was confirmatory.  An EEG revealed no
cortical activity.

Because the family had obtained a restraining order preventing
discontinuation of supportive devices, his body was maintained
in the ICU for several days after his death.  Monks from his
religion came and performed rituals several times.  After
resolution of the legal issues, we discussed particular
specifics of the method of discontinuation of support with his
family's attorney. The court's guardian ad [**Name2 (NI) 5352**] was present in
person; the hospital's attorney was present by conference call;
the judge in the case was notified and agreed.  All details were
followed: his intravenous mediations were allowed to run out;
several hours later, his heart stopped beating.  The ventilator
was then disconnected and the nasal and oral tubes removed.  The
family and attorneys were immediately notified after the
cessation of heartbeat.  The family was contact[**Name (NI) **] several times.
 No one from the family came to perform post-mortem rituals, so
the CCU nursing staff followed documents (provided by the
family) which detailed some of these practices.  In particular,
the patient was left on the ICU, undisturbed, for a full eight
hours after cessation of the heartbeat.  Recorded chants played
at all times.  After eight hours, he was transferred to the
morgue with the chants still playing.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86497**] is a 70-year-old man with dyslipidemia,
hypertension, diabetes, overweight, coronary artery disease,
atrial fibrillation, COPD, presenting after cardiorespiratory
arrest at home.
.
Mr [**Known lastname 86497**] felt unwell yesterday, short of breath and out of
sorts. This resolved somewhat, but today he again became even
more short of breath before collapsing at home. His daughter was
at home with him and began chest compressions after calling 911.
AED pads were placed on him en route and it his rhythm was
shocked, purportedly while in VF, although we cannot confirm. He
then became asystolic, given epinephrine, atropine,
defibrillated again twice, given amiodarone and intubated in the
field. Went to [**Hospital3 **], by which time he was in sinus
rhythm with normal blood pressure. Significant labs from that
admission include D-dimer in 2400s. Cooling commenced and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Upon arrival in the ED his HR was noted to be in the 80s, blood
pressure in 140s/80s. Oxygen saturation was 98%. He was having
irregular myoclonic jerks in the ED. Cooling was continued and
he was sent to the cath. lab. In the cath. lab. his right
dominant system revealed some diffuse, non-flow-limiting
disease, that did not warrant intervention (see summary of cath
findings below).
.
He was transferred to the CCU, already intubated and sedated.
Vital signs on arrival were 94.8 F, 117 BPM, 142/85 mmHg, RR 21
and 100% O2 saturation (ventilated on CMV, 22 x 500, PEEP 5,
FiO2 100%).

Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated
two-vessel disease. The LMCA was short and had no
angiographically
apparent stenosis. The LAD had minimal disease. The LCx had
serial
stenoses, with the distal lesion appearing ulcerated but without

significant stenosis. The ramus intermedius had mild disease.
The
RCA was chronically occluded proximally and filled via
left-to-right
collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial blood
pressure.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two-vessel coronary artery disease.
.
[**2119-4-4**]
CTA Chest
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly including left/right heart.
3. Moderate interstitial fluid edema.
4. Extensive bilateral lower lobe atelectasis/near lobar
collapse.
.
[**2119-4-4**]
Head CT
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Extensive
periventricular white matter hypodensities which may represent
sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease; however,
given patient's history, infarct cannot be excluded.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: As above, there is no
intracranial hemorrhage. Allowing for the evidence of severe
sequelae of chronic microvascular infarction, there is no
finding to suggest acute vascular territorial infarction. There
is disproportionate 3rd and lateral ventriculomegaly, which may
represent central atrophy.
.
[**2119-4-7**]
EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to severe
suppression of the background. This findings is consistent with
a severe
anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Note is made of rhythmic muscle
artifact
extending from the bitemporal to bifrontal regions as detailed
above but
without apparent eleptiform activity. There was no evidence of
electrographic seizures in this recording. Compared to prior 24
hours,
this study is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
After completing the cooling protocol in the CCU, attempts were
made to wean the patient's sedation. When this was done,
persistent myoclonic jerking was noted without any improvement
in mental status, requiring re-sedation and, at times, even
paralysis to maintain synchrony with the ventilator. Neurology
followed the patient throughout his hospital course and, based
on the findings of early myoclonus and a markedly abnormal EEG,
felt that his chance for a meaningful neurologic recovery was
minimal. In light of this, the patient's family changed his
goals of care to be comfort only. He was extubated and expired
shortly thereafter.
.
Of note, the patient did develop a fever one day prior to death
and a CXR was suspicion for VAP. Empiric broad spectrum
antibiotics were started, but stopped when the patient became
CMO.

Chief Complaint:
Cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central lines, intubation with mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
22M h/o surgery for transposition of the great vessels, brought
by ambulance to the ED in PEA arrest. He was reportedly in the
process of being arrested for alcohol intoxication, and became
unresponsive - details unclear. EMS flagged down by police,
found face-down with abrasions on his face. Police told EMS that
patient fell from standing position. Received epi x 2 and
atropine in field. ""No shock"" rhythm x 2 on defibrillator. AED
transiently showed VF, but before could shock, went into
wide-complex tachycardia with pulse. Intubated in field with
difficulty. On arrival to ED, lost pulse, in PEA arrest with
wide-complex tachycardia. Received additional epi x 1, atropine
x 1, vasopressin, CaCl, 1 amp bicarb, narcan, and one 3mg dose
epi. Pulseless for approximately 10 minutes, after which patient
regained pulse and pressure, which rose to SBP 150. Initial labs
notable for lactate 10.9, wbc 13.7, EtOH 137. ECG with sinus
tachycardia, no acute ST or T-wave changes. Head CT showed no
bleed, C-spine CT showed no fracture, chest CT showed no PE or
acute dissection.  Adjunctive hypothermia was induced using the
Arctic Sun System, and given a dose of vecuronium, started on
fentanyl/versed. Prior to vecuronium, pupils noted to be 6mm and
non-reactive. Transferred to ICU for further management.

TTE (Congenital, complete) Done [**2157-6-8**]
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Small LV cavity. Depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Markedly dilated RV cavity.
Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis. Cannot exclude RV mass.
Prominent moderator band/trabeculations are noted in the RV
apex.
AORTIC VALVE: No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate to severe [3+] TR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
There is evidence for D-Transposition of the Great Arteries with
ventriculo-arterial discordance. The patient is s/p palliative
inter-atrial baffle (Senning). The right ventricle is anterior
and appears systemic. The systemic ventricle (RV) is markedly
dilated with severe global hypokinesis. RV thrombus cannot be
excluded. There is moderate to severe tricupsid regurgitation.
The interatrial baffles appear patent without leakage (vena cava
to LA and pulmonary venous to RA baffles well visualized). The
left ventricle is connected to the pulmonary artery. It is small
and hypokinetic. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: D-Transposition of the Great Arteries s/p
interatrial baffle palliative surgery. Baffles appear patent
without leakage. The systemic ventricle is markedly dilated with
severe hypokinesis c/w systemic ventricular failure.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2157-6-8**] 1:32 AM
CTA CHEST: There is no PE. The heart is enlarged with Right
ventricular
hypertrophy noted. Subcarinal and medistinal hypodensity is
likley post
surgical. The lungs demonstrate patchy airpace disease, worse on
the right
with adjacent atelectesis. abberrent anatomy including drainage
of the
pulmonarty veins into the left ventricle.
CTA ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, and adrenals are unremarkable.
Thin,
hyperdense material in the right lobe of the liver is of
uncertain
significance or etiology. The liver is otherwise unremarkable.
The large and small bowel are unremarkable. There is no free
fluid or free air.
Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lesions
IMPRESSION:
1. No PE or dissection.
2. Aspiration pneumonia.

.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2157-6-8**]
NON CONTRAST CT C-SPINE: There is no fracture or malalignment to
the level of T1. Straightening of the normal lumbar lordosis is
noted.
4-mm low attenuation focus within the left lobe of the thyroid
gland likely represents a thyroid cyst. A dedicated thyroid
ultrasound examination could be performed to further evaluation
this finding as clinically indicated on a nonemergent basis. The
evaluation of the prevertebral soft tissues is limited due to
intubation. IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2157-6-8**]
HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles
and sulci are normal in size and configuration for the patient's
age. There is again sinus opacification involving the maxillary,
ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses, which may represent polypoid
opacification or chronic sinusitis.
IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage or cerebral edema.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2157-6-8**]
FINDINGS: The heart size is enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are normal. The left lung is clear. Increased
opacification of the right lung is related to the combination of
the positioning and right lung base infiltrate.  No pneumothorax
and no pulmonary vascular congestion. The endotracheal tube
projects 7.3 cm above the carina.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary edema.
2. Opacification of the right lung base compatible with
aspiration or
atelectasis.
.
MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2157-6-10**]
MR OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT IV GADOLINIUM: Vertebral
height, signal
characteristics and alignment are preserved. There is no
evidence of acute
fracture or spondylolisthesis. There is no STIR evidence of
edema of the
ligaments or vertebral bodies. Cervical spinal cord has normal
signal
characteristics. Mild disc bulges are noted at C4-5 and C5-6 but
there is no significant central canal or neural foraminal
stenosis. Paraspinal soft
tissues are unremarkable.  IMPRESSION: No evidence of
ligamentous injury of the cervical spine.
.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2157-6-10**]
There is increased signal and restricted diffusion in bilateral
putamen,
caudae and cortex of the calcarine fissure, right greater than
left, right
parietal cortex and bilateral rolandic fissures. Findings are
compatible with hypoxic injury to the brain. Ventricles are not
enlarged.
Extensive pansinus opacification is unchanged. There is also
right mastoid opacification.  Intracranial flow voids are
maintained.  MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates no
evidence for aneurysm or stenosis. IMPRESSION: Findings
compatible with diffuse hypoxic injury to the brain.  Findings
were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at the time of attending
interpretation.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2157-6-9**]
The endotracheal tube is in the thoracic inlet projecting 9 cm
above the
carina and needs to be advanced. Heart size is enlarged. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The left lung is
clear. Opacification of the right lung base is unchanged
consistent with atelectasis at the right lung base. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:
ET tube in thoracic inlet.
Unchanged right lung consolidation compatible with
atelectasis/aspiration.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2157-6-11**]
Endotracheal tube terminates about 3.3 cm above the carina. A
feeding tube has been removed. Unusual configuration of
cardiomediastinal contours is consistent with the patient's
history of congenital heart disease. Minimal residual hazy
opacity persists within the right lung, but has markedly
improved compared to earlier study of [**2157-6-9**].
.
CHEST XRAY - [**6-13**] - Cardiomegaly, specifically the right
[**Doctor Last Name 1754**], with upturning of the cardiac apex. Complete
resolution of the pulmonary edema. The patient was extubated.
.
EKG - [**6-14**] - Sinus rhythm. Biatrial abnormality. Right axis
deviation. Incomplete right bundle-branch block. Diffuse
repolarization abnormalities. Possible right ventricular
hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2157-6-11**]
multiple abnormalities as noted persist without major change.
.
CXR - [**6-14**] - AP chest radiograph compared to [**2157-6-13**] shows
no significant change allowing for patient rotation. No
consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion is detected. The
heart remains moderately enlarged, unchanged from prior exam.
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Post-surgical changes
related to median sternotomy are demonstrated. NG tube
terminates within the stomach.
.
CXR - [**6-19**] - Endotracheal tube has been placed. The tube
terminates just above the thoracic inlet. The heart is mildly
enlarged. The lungs appear grossly clear. The right costophrenic
angle has been omitted from the study.

Brief Hospital Course:
22M h/o Senning procedure for D-transposition of the great
vessels, brought by ambulance to the ED in PEA arrest,
mechanically intubated and placed on cooling protocol,
successfully extubated with MRI findings and clinical findings
of anoxic brain injury, with subsequent cardiac arrest with
ventricular dysarrythmia on hospital day #11 with ultimate
result of death.

1.  PEA cardiac arrest/Rhythm/cardiac arrest - Unclear etiology
with conflicting reports regarding circumstances and timing of
CPR initiation.  Arrest thought secondary to increased
catecholinergic state, acute RV failure, hypoxia, or possibly
other cause (eg. commotio cordis).  Patient was at increased
risk arrythmia due to his baseline congenital heart disease,
specificially at an increased risk for a junctional rhythm and
atrial arrythmia, especially atrial flutter, or ventricular
arrythmias are not uncommon.  Unclear initial presenting rhythm
at onset of event.  As per HPI, BLS/ACLS continued in field and
into [**Hospital1 18**] ED with endotracheal intubation with reacquisition of
pulse and pressure.
   Patient was transferred to CCU and initiated on Arctic Sun
cooling protocol for 36-hour period and remained on mechanical
ventilation, without complication.  Patient was cooled without
complication.  Telemetry throughout hospitalization did not show
any abnormal runs of ventricular tachycardia.  On [**2157-6-15**]
consultation was requested of the Electrophysiology Service.
Their plan was to perform an EP study the following week with
the asistance of an electrophysiologist from [**Hospital1 11900**].
   At 12:47 AM on [**6-19**] (morning of death), patient found to be
hypoxic and without a pulse (1:1 sitter noted upper extremity
arm movement just prior to event).  Code blue initiated with
initial rhythm of PEA for 4 minutes, then subsequent pulseless
ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation for next
thirteen minutes.  BLS/ACLS algorithms followed with anesthesia
placement of endotracheal intubation and surgical placement of
femoral central venous line.  Patient reacquired perfusing
pressure, pulse, with tachycardia narrow-complex rhythm at
1:00am, with subsequent re-transfer to CCU.   At 1:10am, patient
converted into pulseless ventricular tachycardia and received
ACLS algorithm, with reacquisition of pressure and pulse at 1:14
AM.  From 1:14 AM to 2:02 AM, patient had perfusing pressure,
pulse, and narrow complex tachycardia with periods of
bradycardia.  At 2:02 AM, patient again converted into pulseless
ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, prompting
ACLS algorithm until 2:28AM.  Resuscitive efforts were
discontinued at 2:28 AM with agreement from participating team
members.  Members of team present throughout code were ICU
intensivist, cardiology fellow, anesthesia resident and intern,
anesthesia attending, respiratory therapist, and CCU nursing
staff.  Attending of record, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was several times
contact[**Name (NI) **] during code.
     Patient's family was called on two occasions, once upon
transfer to CCU after 1AM and at 2:40 AM.  Medical examiner was
called at 3:30 AM, with case accepted.  Family arrived at room
at 5:30 AM, all questions answered by medicine housestaff and
CCU nursing staff.

2.  Cardiac function - as above, patient had congenital
transposition of the great vessels, s/p Senning reparin in [**2134**]
with severe RV dilation (increased in severity since prior ECHOs
obtained from [**Hospital1 **]--by report, then re-verified after
retrieval of echocardiogram images).  Patient's previous cardiac
MR reviewed from 2 years ago as compared to echocardiogram here
suggested similar cariac function.
     Patient did not show evidence of fluid overload throughout
his hospitalization, and aside from intial diuresis on D#2 of
hospitalization, patient was kept euvolemic throughout his stay.
.
3.  Neurologic Status - as above, patient received Arctic sun
cooling protocol on admission for duration of 36 hours.  From
[**6-8**] to [**6-11**] patient remained intubated, limiting adequate
neurological evaluation; when sedation was lessened, we would
open his eyes, move his trunk, and gag vigourously, without
clear evidence if these movements were purposeful.  Upon
transfer to the medicine floor, patient was able to answer some
simple questions appropriately, but with significant dysarthria,
with muscoloskeletal deficits in upper trunk and left upper
extremity.
     Initial CT of the head upon admission showed no acute
abnormalities.  Subsequent MRI of the head post-intubation was
consistent with diffuse anoxic brain injury; however, the
long-term implications of the anoxic injury were unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) 62847**] consult followed patient throughout his stay.
.
4.  Respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia - patient initially
intubated for airway protection during cardiac arrest and
remained intubated through cooling protocol.  Patient's chest
imaging initially demonstrated bilateral opacities, right
greater than left and was initiated upon Unasyn empirically for
aspiration pneumonia.  Following discontinuation of cooling
protocol, patient was extubated on [**6-12**] with adequate gag reflex
and alertness without event.  Due to temperature to 101.9,
antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Zosyn, with
completion of a ten-day course of these antibiotics with
resolution of fevers with markedly improved secretions.
   On days following extubation, patient was noted to have
apneic periods of variable durations with stable oxygen
saturations >90%.  ABGs did demonstrate pO2 decreases during
apneic periods to 50s, despite maintaining adequate peripheral
oxygen saturations.  A pulmonary consult was placed, with a
modified sleep study being performed while still in the CCU,
with recommendations for CPAP support.  Plan was for outpatient
sleep study.
.
5. ETOH withdrawal - undetermined chronicity or quantity of
alcohol ingestion prior to hospitalization.  Patient initially
with ethanol level upon admit, with midazolam utilization for
sedation for intubation.  Patient showed no signs of withdrawal
following extubation.
.
6.  fEN - patient was initially started on tube feeds while
still intubated, then advanced to softs/pureed prior to transfer
to floor, without apparent issue.  One hour prior to ultimate
cardiac arrest, patient had eaten applesauce with crushed pills
without apparent difficulty, fed by nursing staff.
.
7.  PPX - patient was kept upon H2 blockade and SC heparin for
GI stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis.
.
8.  Contacts - mother - [**Name (NI) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62848**], [**Name2 (NI) **]r: [**Name (NI) **]:

with any individuals other than family was upheld througout
hospitalization.

History of Present Illness:
68yo M no known signifigant PMH (no regular medical care)
presents s/p arrest at son's house.
.
History was obtained via son, since patient was intubated and
unresponsive at time of arrival. Patient was sitting in son's
den watching TV today. Son noted that he had to remind his
father three times of the names of the teams playing in the game
they were watching (MS very strong at baseline). Son left room
and then returned to find patient ""blue"" and unresponsive,
upright in chair. + urinary incontinance. No stool incontinance.
No shaking. Son immediately assisted pt. to floor and began CPR.
Pt. rec'd CPR for 5 min. before EMS arrived, at which time he
was found by EMS apnic and pulseless and in VFib. Shocked at
200J x 1 --> asystole --> shock 200J times one --> narrow
complex tach with pulses. 100mg Lidocaine bolus given followed
by Lido drip. Taken to [**Hospital3 **], where he recd Etomidate
drip, Succinilcholine, Ativan, Nitro drip, rectal ASA. Pt
intubated after multiple attempts (failed intubation in field).

.
On arrival to the ED, HR 107 BP 154/90 RR16 100%, intubated. ECG
showed no ST segment elevations but atrial fibrillation, LVH and
diffuse non-specific ST segment depressions. CXR showed on
prelim read wide mediastinum with BL basilar infiltrates and
left sided air bronchogram. Pt was given 20.5mg Integrilin bolus
followed by 113.6mcg/min, Heparin drip, Lidocaine 2mg/min drip,
Plavix 600mg and Metoprolol 10mg IV.

CXR:
CONCLUSION:
1. The NG tube appears to be folded on itself within the
esophagus and should
be repositioned. The ET tube has its tip approximately 90 mm
from the carina
and needs repositioning.
2. Heart is enlarged and the mediastinum is widened. If there is
clinical
suspicion of mediastinal vascular injury, cross-sectional
imaging is
recommended.
3. Indistinct pulmonary vasculature may represent pulmonary
edema. Other
possibilities like infection or aspiration are not excluded.

ECHO:
The left and right atria are moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is mild to moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with global biventricular hypokinesis.

CT_Head:
IMPRESSION: Very limited study without evidence for intracranial
hemorrhage,
loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction differentiation (where
visualized), and
demonstrating patent foramen magnum. Recommend MR for more
detailed
evaluation of possible hypoxic injury.

Cardiac Arrest: The patient was found ""blue"" and unresponsive by
son. CPR was initiated and EMS arrived within 5 minutes. Patient
was found by EMS apneic and pulseless and in VFib. Shocked at
200J x 1 --> asystole --> shock 200J times one --> narrow
complex tach with pulses. 100mg Lidocaine bolus given followed
by Lido drip. Taken to [**Hospital3 **], where he recd Etomidate
drip, Succinilcholine, Ativan, Nitro drip, rectal ASA. Patient
was intubated after multiple attempts, failed intubation in
field.

On arrival to the ED, HR 107 BP 154/90 RR16 100%, intubated. ECG
showed no ST segment elevations but atrial fibrillation, LVH and
diffuse non-specific ST segment depressions. Pt was given 20.5mg
Integrilin bolus followed by 113.6mcg/min, Heparin drip,
Lidocaine 2mg/min drip, Plavix 600mg and Metoprolol 10mg IV.

He was transferred to the CCU and continued on heparin gtt and
integrilin. Je was initated on the hypothermia protocol to gaurd
against cerebral reperfusion injusry for 24hrs. The patient
eventually converted to sinus rhythm and HR slowed to 40s. Per
review of literature, this is normal for patient's undergoing
cooling.  The patient was evaluated by neurology who initatied
continuous EEG monitoring.  He also had a CT-head that showed no
intracranial hemorrhage.  The patient completed 24hrs of
cooling.  The EEG showed no cortical activity and neuro exam
revealed little/no brainstem relfexes.  A family meeting was
arranged and given his poor prognosis for meaningful recovery
the family made the patient CMO.  He was extubated and placed on
a morphine gtt. The patient passed on [**2146-5-26**] at 5:15am.

CXR:
No priors available for comparison. Today's examination is
markedly limited by low lung volumes causing crowding of the
bronchovascular structures. The right hemidiaphragm is
asymmetrically elevated in comparison to the left hemidiaphragm.
There is marked distention of the stomach and abdominal bowel
likely related to resuscitative effort. Slightly increased
spacing between the gastric bubble and the left hemidiaphragm
may suggest a component of subpulmonic effusion. There is an
ill-defined retrocardiac opacity which may reflect atelectasis
and/or sequelae of aspiration. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7
cm from the carina. The aorta is slightly ectatic and calcified
and there is multilevel degenerative changes of the spine. No
pneumothorax or large effusions are identified.

IMPRESSION:

1) Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube. Gaseous
distention of stomach and bowel likely related to resuscitative
efforts. NGT may be of benefit.

2) Ill-defined retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis
and/or sequelae from aspiration.

CTA Torso:
1. No etiology for acute arrest identified. No PE or aortic
dissection. Mild dilatation of the right main pulmonary artery
may suggest underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.

2. Moderate amount of secretions distal to the endotracheal tube
within the trachea proximal to the carina may place the patient
at risk for aspiration.

3. Non-obstructive left renal calculi and simple left renal
cyst.

4. Incompletely characterized right adrenal lesion, likely
benign on patient of this age. Hypoattenuating right thyroid
lesion also likely benign in a patient's age.

5. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.

6. Extensive vasculopathy. Is there a history of diabetes?

TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is small. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

EEG:
 This is an abnormal EEG due to the existence of an active
area of epileptogenesis in the left posterior frontal to
anterior
temporal region. Though this activity did not meet criteria for
focal
status epilepticus, there were periods of apparent
electrographic
seizures without evident clinical correlate. The presence of a
slow and
disorganized background is consistent with a moderate
encephalopathy of
toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2189-2-9**] 9:17 PM
1. No fracture or malalignment is detected.
2. Diffuse calcification of the transverse ligament adjacent to
the dens causes severe canal narrowing and cord impingement. The
thecal sac measures approximately 5 mm at this area.
3. Hyperdense focus within the lower pole of pons and upper
medulla, might represent intraparenchymal hemorrhage or
cavernoma.
4. Bilateral thyroid nodules which can be further evaluated on
nonemergent basis.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2189-2-9**] 9:15 PM
SMALL INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMOORHAGE IN THE OCCIPITAL HORNS AND
SMALL FOCUS OF HEMORRHAGE IN THE UPPER MEDULLA. HOWEVER, THE
CAUSE OF THIS IS UNCERTAIN FROM THE PRESENT STUDY. A CLOSE
FOLLOW-UP EXAMINATION OR MR HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST,
WOULD BE HELPFUL.

MRI HEAD/CSPINE [**2189-2-11**]
1-cm hemorrhagic non-enhancing lesion of the caudal medulla with
expansion and edema. This finding may represent a hemorrhagic
infarct versus a cavernoma. Given the findings on the concurrent
MR cervical spine, a hemorrhagic infarct is favored. Hemorrhagic
neoplasm is thought to be less likely given the lack of contrast
enhancement and no prior history of cancer.
Multiple extra-axial partially calcified enhancing masses as
described above consistent with meningiomas.
Intraventricular blood as before.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented with syncope of unknown etiology, but
likely secondary to ischemia/hemorrhage in her caudal medulla
and also found to have cervical lesion and edema causing canal
stenosis and compression. She was initially treated with cooling
protocol due to possible cardiac arrest, but found to be in
sinus rhythm. Patient was intubated and not breathing
spontaneously. Initially, patient evaluated by CT head on [**2-5**]
that showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass. Unable to do MRI
as patient with staples from prior meningioma surgery from
[**2120**]. We did daily neurologic assessments to follow recovery
s/p cooling protocol, showing patient was awake, sometimes
tracking with her eyes, with some facial movements, but not
moving any extremities. Repeat CT head/spine on [**2-9**] showing
multiple hemorrhages including a lesion in her caudal medulla
and edema/mass around her cervical spine. Neurology was
following and after speaking to neuroradiology, patient was
deemed safe to have MRI evaluation. On [**2-10**], patient evaluated
by MRI which showed same findings. Read of MRI showing two
hemorrhagic/ischemic lesions of the caudal medulla and cervical
cord with severe cord compression. No indication for any
surgical intervention per neurosurg and neurology.Patient
trialed twice on PSV with no spontaneous respirations. One week
after insult, family meeting arranged to discuss poor prognosis
given lack of recovery and goals of care. Family made decision
not to remove care but to place patient on spontaneous breathing
trial without reinstating intubation.  The patient failed the
the SBT and expired 8 minutes afterwards.

History of Present Illness:
76yo W h/o multiple systems atrophy, paroxysmal AF on aspirin,
DM2, HTN, HL, lumbar spinal stenosis who presents with a cardiac
arrest. Per family, the patient was at home and was having some
difficulty with her secretions (choking sounds) when she
suddenly collapsed. CPR was initated by the family, and the fire
department arrived with pads, which advised no shock.
Subsequently she was to be pulseless, with PEA bradycardia, and
was given 1 mg epinephrine, with ROSC. Enroute, she lost pulse
again, with similar pads advising no shock, and was given
another 1 mg epinpehrine, with ROS. At the scene, she was
intubated, a left lower extremity IO was placed. She did not
lose pulses in the emergency department, and was placed with a
right femoral triple lumen, started on amiodarone gtt, as well
as levophed. EKG was ready by cardiology fellow as likely atrial
fibrillation with LBBB. She had a CT head, which was negative.
Of ntoe, she was recently discharge [**2171-10-12**] with a stuttering
course of 24-48 hours of left facial weakness and leaning to the
left in addition to difficulty in swallowing. At that time, a
head CT was negative for acute ischemic or hemorrhagic, and the
team felt that MRI would not change the treatment MRI was not
performed and she was
continued on conservative treatment. She at that tiem was also
noted to have difficulty swallowing, as well as occasionally
SBPs in the 180s, for which she was started on lisinopril. At
that time, she developed fever and as U/A was positive for
bacteria she was started on ceftriaxone for 3 days, but was
subsequently discontinued after urine culture reportedly came
back negative, although cultures here appear to be positive for
VSE.
Labs notable for an ABG with 7.17/58/159, K 2.4, Lactate 8.5,
HCT 95, and a free calcium 0.95. WBC elevated at 15.6, HCT 32,
Plt 188. U/A was very dirty with large leuks, large blood, many
RBCs and WBCs, and mod bacteria.
On arrival to the MICU, she is intubated and sedated.

Brief Hospital Course:
76F history of multiple systems atrophy, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation on aspirin, DM2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
lumbar spinal stenosis who was admitted for cardiac arrest. The
etiology of cardiac arrest was likely multifactorial and
potentially related to infection such as toxic megacolon and ?
aspiration. It was also noted that she was hypokalemic as well.
Her husband initiated CPR at home although it was noted that the
patient was DNR/DNI during prior hospitalization. The patient
was treated with standard post-arrest protocol including cooling
for neuroprotection. She was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia, C.
difficile given toxic megacolon despite negative stool antigen,
and urinary tract infection. Surgery consultation was deferred
given the patient was not an operative candidate. Continuous EEG
was performed showed minimal cortical activity. Code status was
also changed to DNR/DNI as if the patient were to re-arrest, it
would be unlikely that further resuscitation would be effective.
After re-warming, the EEG remained flat with intact respiratory
drive on pressure support. A discussion was held with her family
including her husband regarding likely poor neurological
prognosis. It was decided to pursue comfort-focus measures. The
patient was extubated and subsequently died on [**2171-10-20**]. Family
was notified and declined autopsy.

CTA Chest
1. Severe emphysema with superimposed severe pulmonary edema.
Large
dependent bilateral consolidations, likely reflect fluid-filled
alveolar
spaces, though aspiration and infection cannot be excluded.
2. Enlarged pulmonary arteries, compatible with pulmonary
arterial
hypertension, and right ventricular enlargement. No pulmonary
embolus.
3. Acute bilateral anterior rib and sternal fractures, secondary
to chest
compressions.
4. Orogastric tube terminating at the gastroesophageal junction
and should be
advanced. Positioning of the orogastric tube was communicated by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17321**] via telephone at 10PM [**2183-1-20**].
5. Perihepatic ascites.

CT head no contrast
IMPRESSION: Global loss of grey white differentiation,
concerning for global
hypoxia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after cardiac arrest for cooling
protocol. Sent to MICU on two pressors and intubated/ventilated.

In the MICU:

Several minutes after the patient arrived to the floor, he had a
pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest.  A code blue was
immediately called. Chest compressions were initiated. He was
already intubated and ventilated. He received several doses of
epinephrine, vasopressin, ampules of bicarbonate, insulin,
dextrose, calcium chloride, and atropine.  Several vasopressor
drips were started, including vasopressin, norepinephrine,
epinephrine, dopamine, and neosynephrine.  A bicarbonate drip
was started. A bedside echocardiogram by ICU attending Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] showed global hypokinesis but no cardiac tamponade. TPA
was contemplated but not given as he had a negative CTA prior to
arriving to the floor and he likely had pulmonary hemorrhage as
a result of chest compressions given throughout the day. The
patient regained a pulse thirty minutes after initiation of
ACLS. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] spoke to the family and the patient code status
was subsequently determined to be DNR. The family did get an
opportunity to see the patient even during the code blue.
Following continued discussions, with lack of improvement, focus
of care was transitioned to comfort.  The patient expired at
1:33AM on [**2184-1-21**].

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3694**] is a 57 year old male with history of mild
hyperlipidemia who presents s/p VF arrest. Pt was playing
basketball, and his legs buckled, and he fell to the ground, and
hit his head. CPR was started at the scene until the EMS
arrived, ~7-10mins per report. When EMS arrived, CPR was
continued, and he was shocked x3, subsequent asystole, and then
into PEA. CPR was continued until he arrived at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In
the ED, she was given Epi, Atropine, and Bicarb with return of
pulse. ECG demonstrated STE in V2-V3, aVL...
Placed on arctic sun after CT head negative for ICH and sent to
cath lab. Urine tox positive for opioids, but negative
otherwise. Serum tox negative.
.
In the cardiac cath lab, he was found to have a mid-LAD
completely occluded, with DES x1 placed, with return of good
flow. LCx was without disease, and RCA with 40-50% disease. He
required Levophed on low dose continued during the cath. He was
loaded with Prasugrel in the lab, and continued on Integrillin
for 1 hr.
.
Unable to obtain complete ROS given pt intubated and sedated.
Per his wife, prior to this, he was in his usual state of
health. She denied him reporting and chest pressure, pain, or
SOB. His only recent complaints were a mild knee injury.
Otherwise he had been feeling well. He is quite active and uses
an arc trainer at home. He also plays with his 6 year old son.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated severe single vessel disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent disease.  The LAD had an eccentric 50%

proximal stenosis followed by a mid-occlusion after the 1st
setpal and
diagonal.  The 1st diagonal had 50% origin and mid stenoses.
The LCx
was a large, dominant vessel without angiographic CAD.   The RCA
was
non-dominant and had a 50% mid-stenosis.
2. Limited hemodynamics revealed a central aortic pressure of
117/82
mmHg while the patient was on 0.03 mcg/kg/min of Levophed.
3. Successful Export Thrombectomy and direct stenting of mid LAD
with
3.0 X 18 mm ENDEAVOR DES at 12 atms, post dilated with 3.0 mm NC

and normal flow.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe one vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Coma post cardiac arrest.
3. Cardiogenic shock.
4. Successful [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAD

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

CT HEAD W/O [**2180-3-14**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process; specifically no
intracranial
hemorrhage.
.
CXR [**2180-3-14**]:
IMPRESSION: Limited study. Probable retrocardiac atelectasis.
ETT in standard position.
.
CXR [**2180-3-15**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
endotracheal tube might have been minimally advanced. Otherwise,
the radiograph is unchanged, with borderline size of the cardiac
silhouette, partial right upper lobe atelectasis and bilateral
perihilar opacities suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.

.
EEG: IMPRESSION: This prolonged continuous EEG showed an
extremely
suppressed background rhythm early on [**2180-3-15**] during
hypothermia treatment. Over the day, the background improved in
voltage
and frequency. By the end, it showed an encephalopathic pattern
with
slow frequencies in all areas. There were no prominent focal
abnormalities. There were no clearly epileptiform features.
.
TTE [**2180-3-15**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid
to distal septal, anterior, distal/apical akinesis. The basal
lateral wall moves best. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
MRI [**2180-3-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
Diffusion abnormalities in the biparietal cortex, predominantly
in the medial parietal lobes, compatible with ischemic injury or
post-ictal state.
.
MRI [**2180-3-25**]:
IMPRESSION: Bilateral parietal cortical and subcortical
diffusion
abnormalities are noted which indicate progression to white
matter of the
previously noted ischemic lesions secondary to hypoxic injury.
Bilateral
globus pallidi lesions are also noted. No hemorrhage, mass
effect or
hydrocephalus.

.
CTAP [**2180-3-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. 5.8 x 3.2 cm hematoma within the right pelvis may be related
to recent
catheterization procedure. Bilateral fat stranding within the
groins
compatible with instrumentation.
2. Areas of hypodensity and hyperdensity within the left iliacus
and psoas
muscles bilaterally and expansion of the left iliacus. The
increased density suggests this is atleast mostly hemorrhage,
however, given multifocal findings, septic emboli/abscesses are
a consideration.
3. New hyperdense foreign body within the stomach. In a patient
intubated
with feeding tube, foreign body from dental origin is a
possibility.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
56 yo M with Hx of mild HLD who presents s/p VF arrest, now s/p
cardiac cath with DES to LAD and therapeutic cooling. Pt treated
with AED??????s for seizing s/p re-warming, and found to have anoxic
brain injury.  Course complicated by spiking fevers, growing
Haemophilus and E. coli from sputum with concern for aspiration
pneumonia and sinusitis. Pt continued to spike fevers and
antibiotics were broadened. Hospital course also complicated by
anemia multifactorial in origin, s/p 4 units PRBC??????s. Pt then
developed [**Last Name (un) **] [**3-1**] pre-renal etiology. Second neurology opinion
was obtained per family request, and prognosis by two neurology
teams were conflicting. His AED's were temporarily discontinued
due to concern that they may be causing sedation. Keppra was
restarted as pt was having seizures. He continued to demonstrate
poor chance of a meaningful neurologic recovery. On [**2180-4-4**],
Mr. [**Known lastname 103420**] family elected to extubate him and focus on
comfort care.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# S/P VF ARREST, STEMI: Most likely [**3-1**] STEMI and active
ischemia. ECG demonstrating diffuse ST elevations in
inferolateral leads. Pt required several cycles of CPR, shocks
x3, and epi, atropine. Pt s/p DES to mid-LAD as below. He was
placed on arctic sun with q4hr lytes for neuroprotection. He was
managed for STEMI.
Per the wife's report, pt had no previous symptoms to suggest
angina, and had been very active. Received 600mg ASA in ED. Pt
requiring levophed on presentation from cath lab. Pt loaded with
Prasugrel in lab and integrillin. Pt's risk factors included
hyperlipidemia only, on no home meds. Started on Atorvastatin
80mg po daily, Prasugrel 10mg daily, ASA 325mg daily. ACEI and
beta blocker were initially held given hypotension initially
requiring low doses of Levophed. Captopril was started for
afterload reduction; as his BP's tolerated this he was switched
to Lisinopril 2.5 daily. Beta blockade with metoprolol 12.5mg
[**Hospital1 **] was started. A1c was checked for risk stratification and was
5.8; lipids were checked and showed LDL 109. He was continued on
Atorvastatin 80mg daily. His cardiac function appeared to have
recovered appropriately; unfortunately he continued to
demonstrate poor chance of a meaningful neurologic recovery. On
[**2180-4-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 103420**] family elected to extubate him and
focus on comfort care.

.
# Hypoxic Brain Injury: Review of MRI by both radiology and
neurology concerning for extensive hypoxic injury.  MRI
demonstrated diffusion abnormalities in the biparietal cortex,
predominantly in the medial parietal lobes, that were compatible
with ischemic injury or post-ictal state.  Family requested
second neurology opinion, and per Dr. [**Name (NI) 1693**], pt??????s prognosis may
not be as poor as initially thought. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**], possibly
that AED??????s could be contributing to pt??????s mental state. AED's
were then held, temporarily, but restarted given continued
seizure activity. Repeat MRI revealed progression of ischemic
damage. He continued to demonstrate poor chance of a meaningful
neurologic recovery. On [**2180-4-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 103420**] family elected
to extubate him and focus on comfort care.
.
# Seizures: Pt was found to have seizure activity on EEG after
re-warming. Neurology and Epilepsy were consulted. He was loaded
with Keppra; however, he continued to seize and was loaded with
Fosphenytoin. Dilantin levels were checked. MRI was done, which
showed diffusion abnormalities in the biparietal cortex,
predominantly in the medial parietal lobes, compatible with
ischemic injury or post-ictal state.
As above, AED's were briefly held, and then restarted given
continued seizure activity. Rest as noted above.
.
# Respiratory distress: Pt intubated for inability to protect
airway in setting of VF arrest. He was kept on mechanical
ventilation with settings titrated based on ABG's. His seizure
activity and myoclonus would trigger breaths on the mechanical
ventilator this he required propofol to facilitate ventilation.
On [**2180-4-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 3694**] was extubated in keeping with his
living will and his family's wishes.
.
# Fevers, Leukocytosis: During re-warming, pt had elevated
temperature. Pt was cultured. He eventually spiked a fever, and
cultures were re-sent. Sputum cultures grew out  Haemophilus.
MRI also suggested sinusitis as possible source. He was treated
with IV Zosyn. He continued to spike fevers, and WBC climbed
from 10, to 16 to 27. Likely pulmonary source, possibly
aspiration given now speciation of E. coli from sputum. Pt also
growing Haemophilus, and likely sinusitis by MRI. The CT scan
from [**3-20**] also suggestive of possible septic emboli, but thought
to be unlikely. Concern for C. diff given sig leukocytosis, but
negative. He was treated with Vanc/Zosyn/Gent to cover for VAP.
Other possible sources included abdominal given question of
septic embolic on CTAP. ID was consulted. Gent was dc'd given
worsening renal function, and Cipro was started. Zosyn was
switched to Cefepime given MIC of 8 to Unasyn. ID signed off
after goal of care transitioned to comfort care.
.
# Anemia: Multifactorial [**3-1**] UGIB on admission, possibly
continued gastritis given guaiac positive stools (though no
frank blood), phlebotomy, and inadequate production of RBC??????s
with low retic count. Pt also had a CTAP to look for bleed,
which showed small hematomas. Pt had also been on multiple
myelosuppressive medications including zosyn and phenytoin.
Hemolysis labs were negative. Heparin gtt was dc??????d [**3-22**]. Hct
continued to drop, and he was transfused 2 units PRBC??????s [**3-22**],
with appropriate bump in Hct. Concern for continued bleeding
into abdomen given significant cont??????d drop in Hct.  Serial Hct's
showed drop, with no further clear source. He was transfused an
add'l 2 units of PRBC's, for a total of 4 units. His Hct
remained stable.
.
# PUMP:  Pt presented in VF arrest. Unknown prior EF, though pt
with no symptoms per his wife of orthopnea, SOB, etc. CXR looked
like fluid overload, which would not be surprising given STEMI
in LAD region. TTE showed severely depressed EF of 15% with
severe LV dysfunction. Pt had been s/p several cycles of shocks,
and was thought to at least in part have stunned myocardium. He
was started on heparin gtt given apical akinesis and concern for
stroke. Captopril was started, which he tolerated, and was
switched to Lisinopril 2.5mg daily. Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] was
started as above. Pt auto-diuresed initially, but required IVF
given fevers as above. Repeat TTE showed improved LVEF of 50%.
.
# RHYTHM:  As above, presented s/p VF arrest. Pt in sinus with
prolonged PR interval s/p cath. Pt intermittently going into
Vtach after cath. However, rhythm switched to afib on repeat ECG
overnight. On morning of hospital day 1, pt continued to be in
Afib with hypotension, cardioverted with conversion to sinus.
However, pt was then bradycardic, likely [**3-1**] cooling. EP was
consulted. He was started on Lidocaine and Amiodarone gtt.
However, Lidocaine was discontinued given that Amiodarone was
preferred in the context of reperfusion. He was switched to po
amiodarone load. Dopamine was initially given for bradycardia
and hypotension, but weaned off.
He continued on po Amiodarone and remained in sinus rhythm.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Pt??????s Cr bumped from 1.1 to 1.6 on the morning of [**3-23**]
after continued fevers. Thought to be pre-renal in etiology
given diaphoresis and fevers. Ulytes showed FeNA <1%. His UOP
was monitored, and he continued to put out good urine. His
creatinine improved. Gentamycin was dc'd as above. His Cr was
trended and remained stable.
.
# UGIB: Pt had 150cc dark red blood coming up from OGT on
admission, concerning for UGIB. Most likely [**3-1**] to integrillin,
prasugrel and possible gastritis. GI was consulted. Pt had NG
lavage with clearing of blood. Hct's were checked frequently,
and remained stable. He was placed on PPI drip initially, which
was switched to IV BID PPI once Hct stable. H. pylori was sent,
and was negative. GI was consulted prior to starting heparin
gtt. Given that he was not stable for endoscopy, recommended
proceding with heparin as long as pt didn't rebleed. Rest as
above under ""Anemia.""
.
# HEAD LACERATION: The patient sustained a head laceration on
his original fall prior to admission. Plastics was consulted,
and placed several deep and superficial sutures.  Bacitracin was
applied for one day and then dry dressing applied. Sutures were
removed.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year-old woman with scleroderma and EtOH abuse who
was brought to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] today from home by EMS with
complaint of one month of poor PO intake, fatigue, and malaise.
She had been bedridden for months and reportedly had not eaten
in 1 month. She was reportedly hypotensive with SBP 60s on
presentation to the ED at [**Location (un) 620**]. She was sent for a CT head
and abdomen, and when lying flat she apparently started vomiting
coffee ground material and then arrested (CT scan not
completed). She was given CPR, epi x3, atropine x1, HCO3 x2
amps, and pulse returned with sinus rhythm, but hypotensive. She
was intubated and NGT was placed which returned bright red
blood. Hct initially was 18 and Cr 4.4. She was given 4U PRBC
and 6L IVF. DDAVP was given. RSC line was placed, and she was
started on dopamine. She given doses of vanco, zosyn, and
decadron. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival to the ED here, VS: T 88 degrees, BP 128/64 (on
dopa), HR 94, RR 20.
ETT was at 25cm, decreased BS on L were noted, CXR confirmed R
mainstem intubation, so ETT pulled back. NGT from OSH noted to
be coiled in the esophagus, so new OGT was placed with frank
blood and clots initially which cleared with NS and then bright
red blood recurred. FAST exam showed free fluid in the abdomen.
CT scan showed bilateral infiltrates, diffuse colitis, ascites,
fatty liver. Surgery was consulted and felt there is no acute
surgical issue. She was given 4 more L NS, calcium and magnesium
repletion, octreotide gtt, and 2U FFP in the ED. She has
remained on dopamine for hypotension.

HEAD CT:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Air-fluid levels within the paranasal sinuses which most
likely are related to intubation.

CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIX:
1. ETT tip at orifice of right mainstem bronchus. The ETT has
already been repositioned since the CT scan.
2. NG tube curls up in the esophagus.
3. Massive bilateral consolidations which could be related to
aspiration.
4. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
5. Bowel wall thickening of ascending and descending colon and
small abdominopelvic ascites. Primary considerations would be an
infectious process such as C. difficile colitis. Inflammatory or
ischemic causes are other considerations, although ischemia
appears less likely given the distribution.
6. Compression fractures of L2 and L3 vertebral bodies which are
age indeterminate.
7. Right subvlavian line terminates in left brachiocephalic vein
and repositioning is recommended.

EGD:
Impression: Posterior oropharyngeal laceration
Extensive blood clot in the esophagus
Old blood in the duodenum
Erythema and congestion in the whole stomach compatible with
portal hypertensive gastropathy
[**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear
Old blood in the stomach
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Double dose PPI IV
Do not replace NGT/OGT


Brief Hospital Course:
MUTLIFACTORIAL SHOCK:
Ms. [**Known lastname 467**] likely presented with GI illness with poor po intake
and suspected nausea/vomiting given [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, which
led to large GI bleed contributing to hypotension. She likely
aspirated at [**Hospital1 **] when she arrested in the CT scanner,
leading to cardiogenic shock. Sepsis was also included in the
initial differential given that she had bandemia on [**Location (un) 8062**]
CBC, suspicious for pulmonary or GI source, given colitis seen
on abdominal CT. She was supported fully with dopamine and
vasopressin, in addition to volume and blood, FFP, and
cryoprecipitate.

For possible sepsis, she was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics initially in the ED.

A discussion of prognosis was had with the medical intensive
care unit team and the patient's sister, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], who was
listed as next of [**Doctor First Name **]. The decision was made to make the patient
comfort measures only, and vasopressors and mechanical
ventilation were withdrawn, and the patient expired, within 24
hours of admission.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
She was mechanically ventilated for respiratory failure until
CMO decision.
She had bilateral consolidations consistent with aspiration.

GI BLEED:
Upper endoscopy revealed old blood and clot in the esophagus,
stomach, and duodenum, as well as [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear that was
likely the initial culprit of the GI bleed. She also had a
laceration on her soft palate. ENT examined but it was no longer
bleeding. She was treated with IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].

ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:
Recent baseline in CCC of 0.8, up to 2.5 on admission here.
Likely related to hypovolemia from blood loss (pre-renal), plus
Acute Kidney Injury from hypotension. Cr has improved from
initial OSH labs, but still minimal UOP.

METABOLIC ACIDOSIS:
Anion gap acidosis with markedly elevated lactate s/p cardiac
arrest in the setting of hypotension. Also concern for bowel
ischemia, although CT read more consistent with infectious
colitis. POssible contribution from renal failure as well.

ALCOHOL USE:
The patient had history of strong alcohol use. She was treated
with thiamine and vitamins.



Medications on Admission:
Unknown. (?protonix, folate per OSH record; multivitamins,
Protonix, levothyroxine, lorazepam, and Tylenol per [**2161**] OMR

15461,Died,"Admission Date:  [**2109-9-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2109-9-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2032-10-9**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fall off ladder.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old male with
a history of atrial fibrillation, benign prostatic
hypertrophy, history of left carotid bruit, history of
seizure disorder, who was on a ladder the evening of
admission and fell.  He was noted to be pulseless and to be
cyanotic afterwards.  He was given Epinephrine/Atropine with
heart rate in the 30s to 40s.  He had been down for about
fifty minutes.  He had a history of such episodes as well in
the past.  The patient then had been intubated and then
transferred for further treatment to [**Hospital1 190**].  Per family, he had a history of falls about
twelve years ago and nine years ago, but not recently.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of basal cell carcinoma.
2.  Squamous cell carcinoma.
3.  History of left carotid bruit.
4.  Seizure disorder, [**2051**], started with episode of spinal
meningitis.
5.  History of sleep apnea, has been on CPAP.
6.  Atrial fibrillation.
7.  Cataracts.
8.  Contractures.
9.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
10. History of osteoarthritis.
11. History of aortic and mitral regurgitation.
12. Echocardiogram in [**2-23**], showed left atrium moderately
dilated, right atrium markedly dilated, left ventricular
systolic function 60%, 3+ aortic regurgitation, 1 to 2+
mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, mild to
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (37).
13. Stress test in [**1-26**], nine minute modified [**Doctor First Name **] Protocol
showed good exercise tolerance, no 2D echocardiogram evidence
of inducible ischemia to the achieved workload.

ALLERGIES:  Levaquin.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with trigeminal neuralgia.  Siblings
with Parkinson's.  No history of coronary artery disease,
diabetes mellitus or hypertension otherwise.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Active, gardener, walks, one glass per night
of wine, no tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission showed a
temperature of 100.1, pulse range of 101 to 115, blood
pressure 128/59, respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 100%
quantitative saturation.  Generally, the patient was in no
acute distress, intubated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
- diffuse contusions on face.  Cardiovascular is irregularly
irregular.  Respiratory clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities no
edema.  Neurologically, intubated, sedated, moved extremities
but not to command.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
8.5, hematocrit 37.3, platelet count 191,000.  Sodium 131,
potassium 4.1, chloride 97, bicarbonate 20, blood urea
nitrogen 35, creatinine 1.5.  The patient had an anion gap of
17, glucose 240, lactate 7.2.  INR 2.9, partial
thromboplastin time 25.2.  Fibrinogen 194, amylase 59, CK
121, CK MB 4.0.  Urinalysis was negative.

X-ray of the pelvis - The hips are normally aligned without
fractures or dislocations.  Head CT showed no intracranial
bleeding evidence or mass effect.  Low density lesions
consistent with subacute or chronic infarct.  Mild brain
atrophy.  CT also showed no evidence of fractures or
dislocations of cervical spine.  Mild wedge compression
deformity and possible T2 evaluation of prevertebral soft
tissue linked with secondary ETT vacuum phenomenon present of
disc C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7.  Abdominal pelvic CT showed a
small right pleural effusion, bilateral atelectasis, no
intra-abdominal problems.

Electrocardiogram showed findings consistent with atrial
fibrillation.

Urine toxicology screen was negative for all except positive
for barbiturates.  Arterial blood gases while intubated on
admission showed pH 7.52, CO2 29, O2 295 and bicarbonate of
24.  This was on a tidal volume of 700 and rate of 12.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is now status post trauma.
Trauma surgery had evaluated the patient and there was no
plan on treatment.  The patient was transferred to CCU for
observation.  In terms of his neurological symptoms, etiology
of his symptoms that may have led to the fall were unclear,
but thought to be possibly secondary to transient ischemic
attack/stroke.  Neurology was consulted.  Head CT as noted
above, and he was continued on his Tegretol.  For his cardiac
issues, given history of atrial fibrillation, he was rate
controlled with Vasotec, Metoprolol, and his Coumadin was
held given the possibility of the patient going for cardiac
catheterization.  On [**2109-9-25**], the patient was continued on
his cervical collar and log roll precautions per trauma
surgery advice until he was cleared by trauma surgery who is
following peripherally. Head CT again showed no bleed, has a
T1, T2 fracture, new versus old, unsure but needs examination
without sedation to be able to evaluate or a magnetic
resonance scan.  At this point, we are waiting for trauma
team to clear his neck or a magnetic resonance scan which is
planned for the day after.  Neurology had noted given the
patient's past history of transient ischemic attack and
falls, this could have been secondary to transient ischemic
attack and cerebrovascular accident events.  Neurology was
consulted and they recommended a magnetic resonance scan and
a neural check q1hour.  He also has a history of seizures and
they recommended to continue his home medications Mebaral and
Tegretol and levels pending and a.m. results.  Also, they
ordered an electroencephalogram once the patient is off the
cervical collar and stable.  Cardiac was continued as
discussed before.  His electrocardiogram had shown ST
depressions in V4 to V6.  He was kept on Aspirin and beta
blockers for his cardiac care and we are cycling enzymes
while the patient was on our service.  There is a question of
maybe the patient might go to cardiac catheterization
laboratory once INR has decreased.  At the time of admission,
INR was 2.9.  He was being rate controlled with Vasotec and
Metoprolol as discussed previously.  The morning before the
patient had passed away the patient was continued still on
the cervical collar and log rolling precautions.  Orthopedics
had come on board to clear spine and there was a thought that
the patient might have had a cerebellar infarct.  Per
neurology recommendation, the patient was also started on
steroids to decrease possible inflammatory processes that
could contribute to the patient's symptoms.  Cardiac as
before with no change.  It was thought the patient was going
through generalized seizures based on electroencephalogram
results.  On [**2109-9-27**], there was no improvement in mental
status when evaluated the patient.  The patient was started
on Dilantin the day before the time of death, but no
improvement was noticed in the patient's condition.  On
[**2109-9-27**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had discussed with daughters and wife
regarding the patient's prognosis and recovery chances.  At
that time, the patient's family felt that he would not want
to be resuscitated.  Also, the family had agreed that no more
medical support should be necessary since that could prolong
the patient's suffering while in the hospital.  At 4:30 p.m.
on [**2109-9-27**], resident physician was called to bedside for the
patient being unresponsive.  The pupils were fixed,
nonreactive, no audible heart sounds were felt, followed one
minute, no sounds still, no spontaneous respirations, no
response to sternal rub.  The family was notified immediately
and the attending physician was also notified immediately.
Time of death at that point was called at 7:25 p.m. on
[**2109-9-27**].

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU from the ED after CT scans
of the head and torso were performed. The CT head demonstrated
diffuse cerebral edema. The CT torso demonstrated bilateral
dependent consolidations concerning for aspiration; no pulmonary
embolism. There was severe acidosis requiring bicarbonate
infusions. The patient was hypotensive, requiring ultimately 4
pressors to keep the MAP above 60. He eventually became
difficult to oxygenate, despite maximum support on the
ventilator, including trials of repositioning and inhaled nitric
oxide. Antibiotics were given. There was evidence of dense renal
failure as well as liver failure, with coagulopathy. The patient
received transfusions of FFP and pRBCs.  The patient was noted
to be 29C on arrival to the MICU; the patient was slowly
rewarmed to a goal of 35C given the concern about
neuroprotection post-arrest but in the setting of coagulopathy
the usual goal of 33-34C was modified to 35C. The Neurology
service was consulted on hospital day 2 and confirmed the very
poor prognosis. The family decided to change the code status to
DNR. The patient's hemodynamics worsened and he expired with his
family present at 13:30. The Medical Examiner was notified and
declined the case. The family elected for a post-mortem
examination and this was arranged. A call was placed to his
PCP's office.

filter), PVD (fem/[**Doctor Last Name **] BPGs), ESRD ([**3-2**] gent), valv dz (AI, MR -
not [**Doctor First Name **] cand) and endocarditis, PVD, DVT, narc abuse, admitted
to the ICU s/p cardiac arrest at home.  Apparently, as relayed
by pt's husband, pt has been SOB x 1 days.  Pt went to bathroom
said that ""she felt she was going to die"" and collapsed.   ,
Documentation from EMS mostly absent, so story per husband and
[**Name (NI) **] reconds.  Apparently, pt was complaining of worsening sob
over thpast day, went to go to bathroom and said she felt like
she was dying and then collapsed.  Husband called EMS, EMS
arrived approx 8 min later and found the patient in asystole.
Pt intubated in field, CPR started, total 8 rounds of epi, 3 of
atropine, Got BP of started cpr given 6 rounds of epi, 3 of
atropine and 1 Nabicarb. had bp of 90/p at one point. total
field code time was 30 minutes.  Lost BP short time later, HR on
monitor read to be 140s with no pulses.  When rolling into the
ED, bounding femoral pules felt,  with hr of 130's. bp then
130/p. Total coding time about 30 mins.

Brief Hospital Course:
51F ESRD on HD, PVD, valvular heart disease admitted to the micu
s/p asystolic arrest of unknown etiology.
.
#s/p asystolic arrest: The patient was found down at home; 8
mins until CPR and then at least 30 mins until return of
circulation. [**Last Name (un) **] etiology.  Differential includes arrythmia
(hyperkalemia, prolonged qt), large PE, overnarcosis, MI.
Cardiac enzymes are elevated but more likely demand than ACS.
Serum and urine toxicology screens were negative. Based upon her
neuro status, in discussion with her family, the patient was
made CMO after >72 hrs of observation. She expired shortly after
extubation.
.
#Neuro: Unresponsive. s/p prolonged downtime (~8mins) with long
resuscitation (30 min).  Evidence of severe anoxic brain injury
on examination and head CT with loss of grey-white
differentiation. Neurology was consulted and recommended repeat
examinations at initial time point and 72 hours after
presentation given renal failure, fevers, and possibly effects
of narcotics. There was no improvement and thus the prognosis
for any neurologic recovery was extremely grim.
.
#Respiratory: Intubated due to asystolic arrest.  Overbreathing
the vent due to acidosis.  Continue mechanical ventilation until
terminally extubated.
.
#CV:
.
Ischmemia: No CP per witness but did c/o SOB which may be
anginal equivalent.  +trops but s/p CPR (no shocks), and ST
changes laterally when going 150 (? rate related). No cath in
our system but abnormal stress test. Cardiac enzymes were
trended and troponin leak likely from hypotension during arrest
rather than ruptured plaque.
.
Pump: Preserved EF.  Known chronic aortic valve vegetation but
not a surgical candidate per multiple evaluations.
.
Rhythm: h/o Afib on anticoagulation.  Patient was in sinus
arrhythmia at presentation with long QT.  Initial arrest may
have been due to torsades and notably she is on seroquel and
topamax as an outpatient. Maintained K>4, Mg>2. Avoided QTc
prolonging drugs.
.
#PVD: Multiple non-healing chronic LLE wounds.  Wound care team
was consulted.
.
#ID: ? infected ulcers given elevated WBC count and fevers.
Colonized by MRSA and ESBL kliebsiella.  Also with UTI and
likely aspirated during arrest.  She was treated with
vanco/ceftriaxone for broad spectrum coverage.
.
#Hematology: Anticoagulated with coumadin for PE and chronic
aortic valve vegetation. She was therapeutic on admission and
then became supratherapeutic likely due to severe hepatic
failure. Coumadin was held.
.
#Endocrine: RISS. Continued IV levothyroxine.
.
#renal: ESRD on HD [**3-2**] contrast/toxin nephropathy.  Renal was
consulted and she was placed on CVVHD for management of anion
gap lactic acidosis due to hypoperfusion.  Her pH on admission
was 7.19 and normalized. She was removed from CVVHD given the
stability of her metabolic status, poor prognosis due to severe
brain injury, and decision to make CMO by family.

History of Present Illness:
42 year old female with h/o SDH [**2-26**], EtOH abuse, ?seizure
disorder admitted to ICU following asystolic arrest. According
to her boyfriend, she was in her USOH until this a.m., when she
went for a walk. She came back and went to the bathroom, where
she collapsed. Her boyfriend heard her fall; when he found her,
he noted jerky motions of her upper ext bilaterally (?duration).
He moved her to the bed, where he saw she wasn't breathing/no
heart beat. He called EMS and started CPR; ~12 minutes before
they arrived. When EMS arrived, she was noted to be apneic,
pulseless, cyanotic, and cold. Initial EKG was asystole. She was
intubated in the field. She received epinephrine 1 mg IV X 3,
atropine 1 mg IV X 2, Narcan 2 mg X 1 -> PEA. Pacing was
attempted unsuccessfully. Another atropine 1 mg IV X 1 was given
and the pt converted to narrow-complex tachycardia (down time ~
20 minutes after EMS arrival). She was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
where a LSC placed and pt received 950 cc NS, Cefazolin 2 g IV X
1, tetanus shot, and started on dopamine gtt. Foley was placed
with drainage of 250 cc of fluid. She is admitted to the MICU
for further management. Further history reveals that she had
stopped drinking alcohol ~ 3 days ago.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was unresponsive on admission s/p cardiac arrest of
unclear etiology with estimated down time of 20-35 minutes.
Clinical picture and the need for aggressive repletion of
electrolytes were most consistent with a starvation/alcoholic
ketoacidosis resulting in electrolyte abnormalities which led to
cardiac arrhythmia and arrest.  The patient had no brain stem
function on admission other than initially breathing over the
ventilator.  She was cooled to 34 degrees celsius for 48 hours
and then rewarmed in an attempt to preserve brain function.
After the rewarming the patient did not develop any further
signs of improving neurologic status and was no longer breathing
over the ventilator, she continued to require pressors to
maintain adequate blood pressure.  After a complete neurologic
exam once all electrolytes had been corrected and the patient
was normothermic, the patient was declared brain dead on
hospital day 3.  The patient's brother was the next of [**Doctor First Name **] and
he elected to donate her organs.  The NEOB then coordinated
further work up and evaluation for organ donation.

83 yo f with PMH significant for CAD, DVT, CHF, presenting with
witnessed asystolic arrest in the field to the ED. Earlier in
the day, she went with her husband to his PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 104515**] with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who is also her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was reportedly feeling well
at that time around 10 AM. In the taxi back to the apartment,
she began to feel diaphortic and unwell. She was helped up to
her apt and then at that time, her husband called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He
then tried to take her BP and was unable. He called EMS at
10:50. They arrived at 11:00 and found the patient apneic,
pulseless, and started CPR. After several minutes, she was
taking agonal breaths and had weak carotid pulses. Vomit was
seen in her mouth. Initial GCS was 3. She was intubated at 11:09
and was still pulseless. At 11;27, she had an initial rhythm of
asystole, which resolved to afib. At 11:28, she had her first
recorded blood pressure. Therefore estimated time pulseless was
40 minutes.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were HR 50, BP 104/54, 16, 99%,
intubated. She then became hypotensive and was started on wide
open levophed and dopamine. She was given 5L NS with no urine
output. She was given ASA 600 PR, dopamine, levophed,
vancomycin, levofloxain 500, flagyl, ativan, dilantin, calcium
chloride. Bedside echo was done which was ""normal"". Cards was
consulted and felt that even if this was a cardiac issue, there
would be no intervention at this time because of her alarming
neuro exam which was documented as pupils fixed and nonreactive.

.
ED was concerned for PE with acute onset SOB, hypotension, and
h/o
DVT. Discussion of lytics, but pt sent for CTA which did not
show PE. CTA showed B/L pleural effusions/ consolidations/ ? air

bronchograms. Head CT negative

There is no new intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift
of normally midline structures, interval development of a major
or minor vascular territorial infarction. The density values of
the brain parenchyma are normal aside from what is likely a mild
degree of bifrontal chronic microvascular infarction within the
periventricular white matter. This abnormality, as well, is
stable since the prior study.

Initial Chest CTA/ Abdomen/Pelvis CT:
1. No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism. No
evidence of
aortic dissection or aneurysm.
2. Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities, slightly improved
compared to
[**2141-12-14**].
3. The nasogastric tube should be advanced further into the
stomach.
4. Peripancreatic fat stranding, which is concerning for
pancreatitis.
Correlation with pancreatic enzymes is suggested.
5. Acute left lateral rib fracture.

[**2142-3-13**] CXR:
1. Right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Improving pulmonary edema.
3. Stable small left effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The etiology of Mrs.[**Known lastname 104516**] asystolic arrest and resultant
anoxic brain injury remained unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 15110**] to the rapid onset and
prodrome of diaphoresis and SOB, it was most likely to have been
cardiogenic in nature. After initial evaluation and
stabilization in the ICU, spoke with Mrs.[**Name (NI) 104516**] husband
about the gravity of the situation, explaining that due to her
physical findings, serious anoxic brain injury was likely.
Placed on dilantin, due to extensive myoclonic activity. Valium
was also used prn when thought to be experiencing greater
myoclonic and possible seizure activity. Also placed on broad
spectrum antibiotics for elevated wbc count and possible PNA on
CXR. Initially required dopamine and norepinephrine for
maintenance of MAP>65; these were weaned off over the first
12-24 hours. Neurology was consulted, who agreed with primary
team's findings, and recommended the addition of valproic acid
for myoclonus and seizure prophylaxis. Multiple discussions were
held with Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his daughter regarding the grave
nature of Mrs.[**Last Name (un) 104516**] condition. They requested that
aggressive treatment be maintained until her second daughter
could fly in from [**Name (NI) 18317**]. This was done, and her clinical
situation continued to decline, with worsening renal and hepatic
function, along with difficulty in finding a ventilatory
strategy that provided adequate oxygenation without very high
pressures, though she remained in stable, though critical,
condition. Once Mrs.[**Last Name (un) 104516**] second daughter arrived, her
family agreed first to make her DNR, and ultimately to change
the focus of care to comfort measures. Mrs.[**Known lastname 104516**] PCP was
also aware of the evolving situation, and came by to speak to
her family. Social work also provided emotional support. At
8:30AM on [**2142-3-14**], Mrs.[**Last Name (un) 104516**] endotracheal tube was
removed. She was placed on a morphine drip and ativan drip, to
be titrated to goals of maximal comfort and minimal respiratory
distress and myoclonic activity. One hour later, housestaff was
called to the bedside. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was unresponsive, with no
visible chest wall expansion. She had no pulse, and had no heart
or breath sounds after two minutes of palpation and
auscultation. She was pronounced dead at 9:30AM. Her husband and
two daughters were present, and declined an autopsy. Her PCP was
notified.

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of insulin dependent
DM, HTN, and cerebrovascular disease who presented after being
found unresponsive at her home and having had a PEA arrest.  The
patient was last seen three days prior to presentation when she
reported feeling somewhat unwell but had no particular
localizing symptoms.  She was not seen in the ensuing days over
the weekend and then today her paperboy noted multiple papers
piled up on the porch.   He called the police who broke into the
house and discovered the patient breathing but minimally
reponsive.  EMS was then called and arrived on the scene found
her in rapid AF with hypotension, intubated the patient in the
field, and brought her to the ED.  En route to the ED the
patient did have a PEA arrest and received epinephrine and
atropine before arriving in the ED where converted to VF,
received one defibrillation attempt, and then another round of
epi/atropine before return of spontaneous circulation though she
was quite hypotensive.  She also received one amp bicarbonate,
six liters of fluid, and was started on phenylephrine.  ET tube
was replaced in ED due to noted abdominal distension and concern
field intubation was esophageal.  PIV placed in the field noted
to be infiltrated with surrounding arm cold.  Labs revealed
leukocytosis to 19.1, lactate of 6.6 and ABG 7.13/65/38.  CT
scan head showed hypoattenuation of the entire left parietal
lobe, CT chest with bilateral pleural effusions/ consolidations
and multiple pulmonary emboli with clot in the left atrial
appendage.  She received vancomycin and pipercillin-tazobactam
for undifferentiated shock.  Cardiology was consulted regarding
atrial fibrillation and recommended against rate control given
it was felt high rate was needed to compensate for poor
contractility post arrest.

EKG: afib with RVR


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/oF with insulin dependent DM, afib not coumadin, recent CVA
w/o residual neurologic deficits found unresponsive at home,
likely down time 2-3 days, in afib with RVR c/b PEA arrest en
route to hospital, now intubated, with massive MCA infarcts, LV
thrombus, bilateral PE.

At presentation it was unclear how long the patient had been
immobilized though her lactic acidosis, high CK, and story of
missing multiple papers would suggest a prolonged
incapacitation.  Unclear what was the primary lesion though
given PE, embolic strokes, and clot in left atrial appendage
would suspect widespread embolism from atrial clot with CVA
causing profound alteration in mental status and obtundation.
Patient likely then with secondary rhabdomyolysis and lactic
acidosis from muscle breakdown, poor perfusion, and likely
hypoventilation/poor perfusion.

At time of her arrival patient with no purposeful neurological
activity, posturing and large areas of ischemia from emboli.
She was in severe shock with two pressors required to maintain
blood pressures likely from components of obstructive (secondary
to PE) and distributive (due to acidosis, SIRS) pathology.
Given these factors prognosis was considered to be extremely
poor.  After arrival of the family and discussion of very poor
prognosis they agreed to make the patient DNR/DNI and withdraw
pressors and life sustaining treatments.  She was started on
morphine drip for comfort, extubated, and vasopressors were
stopped.  She passed away < 30 minutes later.  Family refused
autopsy.

s/p VF arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
A-line placement

History of Present Illness:
75 yo female with DM presenting with VF arrest.  Per patient's
husband, patient was at home with her husband this morning.
Husband was outside walking the dog, and when he walked in heard
his wife call out for him then heard her collapse.  He was at
her side immediately, could not feel a pulse.  He gave her
glucagon as she has a history of hypoglycemia, with no effect.
He called 911 within 5-10 minutes of finding her down.  911
responded within 2 minutes and defibrillated immediately.  She
received three rounds of epinephrine, intubated and started on
dopamine gtt.
.
Initial vital signs in ED were HR 120, BP 75/p.  EKG showed afib
with rate [**Street Address(2) 4531**] depressions in V1-V5.  Initial labs showed
no leukocytosis, normal hematocrit and were significant for a pH
of 7.17, lactate of 8.8, bicarb of 16 and glucose of 178.
Patient was given a lidocaine bolus and started on a drip.  She
was also given levophed for further pressure support in addition
to dopamine drip.  She was seen by cardiology and given an
amiodarone bolus and drip for rate control.  Post cardiac arrest
hypothermia protocol was initiated.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient's VS were HR90 in SR with
frequent PVCs, BP 111/55 on levophed (dopamine was discontinued
prior to transfer).
.
According to husband, patient had no recent complaints of chest
pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.  She has known cardiac history.  She is a type I
diabetic and has neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy.  She is
legally blind.

Brief Hospital Course:
75yo female with Type I diabetes s/p ventricular arrest now on
post-arrest hypothermia protocol.
.
#s/p VF arrest:  Underlying cause of VF arrest is unclear at
this time.  EKG was concerning for potential RCA infarction vs
vasospasm. Patient treated for acute coronary syndrome given
questionable EKG with [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and heparin gtt.  It is
possible that she had an arrhythmia.  Patient has no history of
arrhythmia and electrolytes were all normal on arrival.
Patient's last fingerstick prior to event was 73, so unlikely to
have been related to hypoglycemia.  Patient was pulseless for at
least 5-10 minutes prior to defibrillation.  On arrival to the
ED, she was cooled with artic hypothermia protocol.  She
continued to have lots of ectopy with tachycardia. She initially
required amiodarone gtt but returned to sinus rhythm. EEG showed
burst suppression with seizure activity.  Patient was given a
loading dose of valproic acid.  Patient was rewarmed after 24
hours of cooling. Following rewarming patient was in status
epilepticus.  Neurology was consulted and determined that the
patient had a very poor likelihood of having a neurologic
recovery.  [**Name (NI) **] husband [**Name (NI) 382**] decided to make patient [**Name (NI) 3225**].
Pressure support was withdrawn at this time.  Patient was
continued on fentanyl for pain, propofol for sedation and ativan
for suppression of seizure activity.  Ventilation support was
withdrawn and the electrical activity was no longer seen on the
monitor.  Death was confirmed with absence of corneal reflex,
pupillary response, withdrawal to painful stimuli, as well as
absence of breath sounds and cardiac sounds while auscultating
for 60 seconds.

#Hypotension: Patient has required pressure support since she
was found down.  She is currently on levophed.  This is likely
due to cardiogenic shock in the setting of stunning myocardium.
As above, patient's pressure was supported with levophed.  An
arterial line was placed for close hemodynamic monitoring.  When
the decision was made for patient to be comfort measures,
levophed was discontinued.

#Type I diabetes: Patient is on lantus 14-15U qAM at home.
Blood sugars were controlled with home lantus dose in addition
to an insulin drop.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post ventricular fibrillation
arrest.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old male
who was in his usual state of health until 10:30 when he
became unresponsive, cold, clammy, diaphoretic.  The
patient's wife could not wake him up, and got her son from
upstairs who did mouth-to-mouth while the wife called 9-1-1.
There was about a 20 minute lag between the patient's initial
collapse and getting help from the paramedics.  On arrival,
the patient was noted to be in V fib, shock times two.  The
patient was then intubated, given IV with epi, shocked again
for V fib.  The patient was stabilized at an outside
hospital.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.  He was started on a lidocaine drip at the outside
hospital.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm.  Dopamine was
given for slightly lowered blood pressure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  CVA ten years ago with slight left hand discoordination.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  Silent MI years ago by EKG.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg q.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Zestril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Multivitamin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Daily wine, no tobacco.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No CAD.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.0, blood pressure 121/68, pulse 93, patient is on IMV with
tidal volume of 700, respiratory rate of 14, FI02 of 40%, and
a PEEP of 5.  General:  The patient was obese, intubated,
unresponsive.  HEENT:  The pupils were small and nonreactive.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, distant heart
sounds, question of [**3-9**] SEM at the right upper sternal
border.  Lungs:  Diffuse rhonchi bilaterally anterior.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, hypoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  Trace edema bilaterally.  Neurologic:
Unresponsive.  Does not withdrawal to pain.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 18.4, hematocrit
48.4, creatinine 1.3, INR 4.0, CK 464, MB 18, troponin less
than 0.3.  ABGs showed gas of 7.24, 45, 171.

EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 97, biphasic Ts in V1,
left axis deviated, normal intervals, Q waves and T wave
inversions unchanged, no ST depressions or elevations.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 78-year-old man with V
fib arrest down about 15-20 minutes before being shocked.
Although there is no history of MI documented, the patient
has EKG evidence of prior IMI and anterior MI, V fib was
either ischemic but more likely secondary to scar focus.  At
the outside hospital, the patient received lidocaine drip
which was discontinued here.  The patient required dopamine
for blood pressure support.

The patient ruled out for MI, and eventually came off of all
blood pressure medications.  He was initially noted to have
what appeared to be myoclonic jerks.  It was difficult to say
whether or not these were seizures.  An EEG was obtained
which showed that the patient was in status epilepticus.  The
patient was loaded with Dilantin and given Ativan.
Unfortunately, the patient's mental status never improved.
His reflexes were intact and his pupils were reactive,
however, he had no withdrawal to pain.

Neurology was consulted.  There was a decision made that an
MRI would not be helpful at this point.  A family meeting was
held.  The family thought that the patient would not want
this kind of life.  Given the fact that he was down about
15-20 minutes, the likelihood of anoxic injury is quite
large. The decision was made to withdrawal support.  The
patient expired within several minutes off of the ventilator.

loss of pulse during EMS transport on way to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
Complex story pieced together with family report, ED records,
OMR, and info from ICD interrogation. Per OMR note, patient had
increasing LE edema since 6 days PTA, called Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] and was
told to restart lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **]. Per family report, patient had
not been feeling well for 2 days PTA with fatigue, vague
symptoms. On AM of admission, pt had ICD firing for sensed VT at
11am with LOC prior to shock, with  episode of incontinence. Pt
called Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] at 2pm who thought that patient may be
hypokalemic, told to take 40meq KCL with planned f/u in [**Hospital 3782**]
clinic. Patient then went to park to meet friends with possible
marijuana use (?laced with cocaine) and was found unresponsive
on park bench for unknown amt of time and EMS called.
.
No EMS records, but per ED report, pt had loss of pulse in
transport, was given seconds of chest compressions, and on
arrival in ED at 5:20pm, was in pulseless wide complex
tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT. CPR commenced and pt
given epi 1mg x 1, atropine 1mg x 1, and intubated (initial gas
7/16/32/189), femoral line placed. During course in ED, patient
went in and out of pulseless VT/WCT (loss of pulse for minutes
at a time) requiring intermittent shocks by ICD (x 5 shocks per
ICD interrogation between 4:46pm and 5:39pm), external
defibrillation, and medications (amiodarone, epi, vasopressin,
atropine). When regained pulse, pt hypotensive (SBP 36-67/26-29)
so pt started on Neosynephrine and Levophed. Labs significant
for INR 4.4, Hct 28.2, Cr 1.2, K 2.8. Given 30mg IV KCL, 2mg Mag
sulfate, and given Hct drop from b/l of 32-35, sent for CT head
for concern of bleed in setting of elevated INR. Wet read of CT
head with no bleed, mass effect, or shift. Also given 4amps of
Digibind after labs drawn. Patient lost pulse while down at CT
scan, required one round of epi/atropine/CPR and regained pulse
after 3 min, and was sent up to CCU directly on Neosynephrine at
4.8 and Levophed at 2.6.
.
On arrival to CCU, patient was intubated, sedated with fentanyl
and versed. Met with family for update, identification, and
confirmed full code. Overnight, Arctic sun cooling protocol
initiated, reached goal temperature at 8:30pm. Started on
dopamine, levophed and neosynephrine weaned off. ICD

.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**8-11**]
1.The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include akinesis of the mid and distal septum, mid
and distal inferior wall and apex. The remaining segments are
severely hypokinetic. The remaining left ventricular segments
are hypokinetic.
3. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. There
is an echogenic density in the RV consistent with a pacemaker
lead.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 6.The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure.
7.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD
([**2115**]),  afib on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p
mitral valve repair in [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA
who was found unreponsive and s/p cardiac arrest from unknown
etiology with multiple rounds of ICD firing and ACLS/CPR
admitted on cooling protocol and pressor support. Patient found
to be in polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in setting of
hypokalemia and worsened severe end stage cardiomyopathy
(Patient with known severe cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA
IV sCHF with EF 10-15%). By ICD interrogation, patient had 6
episodes of ineffective ATP leading to shock with one episode at
11am, and one at 4:46pm which may have correlated with patient's
episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed hypokalemia,
acidemia. Utox for cocaine negative and dig level normal. No
evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient was s/p multiple episodes
of loss of pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on
cooling protocol on admission. Patient cooled on Arctic Sun
protocol with goal cooling achieved at 8:30pm of night of
admission. Continuous EEG in place, and per cardiac arrest team,
per EEG and neuro exam post sedation, patient had very little
chance of meaningful neurologic recovery. Patient required
pressors for BP support, which was switched to milrinone and
neosynephrine with no ability to achieve urine output with
lasix. Patient's renal function continued to deteriorate from Cr
1.2 to 4.6, he went into DIC.

Given patient's poor prognosis, critical condition, and low
chance of meaningful neurologic recovery, family meeting was
held on [**6-23**] and patient was made comfort measures only and kept
comfortable with versed for myoclonic movements, morphine gtt,
scopolamine patch, and ativan prn. His pressors were
discontinued, and the patient was extubated at 5:45pm on [**6-23**].
The patient passed away at 2:20 am on [**2120-6-24**] comfortable,
with family at the bedside.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Neuro- The patient was admitted to the CCU following
resuscitation from a v-fib cardiac arrest, after being
unresponsive for an undetermined amount of time.  At the time of
admission, the patient was intubated with profound neurological
deficits including an absent corneal reflex, absent pupillary
reflex, absent gag reflex, no spontaneous movement in her
extremities, and did not show any response to painful stimuli.
Neurology was consulted on the evening of admission, and the
patient underwent a head CT which was negative for acute
hemorrhage.  An EEG was performed the following day which showed
bursts of theta/delta activity and suppressive bursts are all
compatible with a post-anoxic encephalopathy of moderate degree.
There was no sustained seizure activity or clear epileptiform
activity.  The patient underwent a repeat EEG a few days
following admission, which showed no EEG rhythms seen, this
tracing shows worsening compared to the prior EEG and is
suggestive of a poor prognosis. No focal,lateralizing, or
epileptiform features were seen.
2. Cardiac- In terms of her cardiac disease, the patient
underwent an echocardiogram which showed the left atrium to be
moderately dilated, the right atrium is moderately  dilated, the
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Anterior, septal and
apical  hypokinesis to akinesis is present. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. An exact
EF cannot be determined.  The patient was initially placed on
afterload reduction, but was later discontinued on all blood
pressure medications as she became hypotensive.  The patient was
initially made DNR/DNI by her husband, but this was reversed and
the patient was resuscitated again after an asystole cardiac
arrest on the second day of admission.  The patient was
monitored on telemetry and found to be persistently in atrial
fibrillation, was subsequently loaded and started on IV
amiodarone, resulting in effective rate control.  Her
electrolytes were carefully monitored and replaced to avoid
precipitating further arrhythmias.  The patient's blood pressure
remained stable without further intervention.
3. Pulmonary- The patient remained intubated throughout her
hospitalization for respiratory failure thought to be secondary
to cardiac arrest which resulted in ARDS versus aspiration
pneumonia.  The patient was found to have a left-sided
pneumothorax that resolved with chest tube placement.  The
patient was treated with a ten day course of antibiotics and
blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures were all
negative for any significant growth.  After being intubated for
over one week, the patient was evaluated by surgery for trach
placement, which was thought to be likely difficult and
associated with high risk.
4. Renal- the patient's creatinine at the time of admission was
2.1 and rose to 4.0, at which point the patient also became
oliguric, likely secondary to ATN.  The patient's urine output
eventually improved and creatinine trended down to baseline.
5. Endocrine- the patient had a history of hypothyroidism with a
prominent goiter and insulin dependent diabetes.  The patient
was placed on an insulin drip for tight blood glucose control.
Thyroid studies were sent and returned normal.
6. The patient was started on tube feeds for nutrition, and was
maintained on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  In
addition, she was monitored for pain with pain medications
administered as needed.
As her neurological exam remained unchanged throughout her
hospitalization, a number of conversations were had with her
husband and family about goals of care and prognosis.  A
palliative care consult was placed and a family meeting was
arranged which included social work and ethics in addition to
the primary team and palliative care.  It was explained to the
family that further resuscitation would be medically futile and
that the patient would not regain any meaningful quality of
life.  The husband, who was the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy,
decided to extubate the patient and make her comfort measures
only.  The patient was extubated and placed on standing pain
medications and anxiolytics for comfort.  The patient expired
within ten minutes of extubation with her family present at her
bedside.

History of Present Illness:
46yo F with unclear [**Name (NI) 3262**] presenting s/p VF arrest. Per report of
sister, patient sat up in bed complaining that she felt hot and
vomited several times. She lost consciousness, and sister
lowered her to floor and began CPR while 911 was called. On
arrival of EMS, patient was shocked 6 times and got 6 rounds of
epinephrine. Rhythm was ventricular fibrillation. Patient was
given 300mg amiodarone. She was intubated and had return of
spontaneous circulation.
.
In ED, ECG showed ST elevations in II, III, avF, V4-V6. A code
STEMI was called. Patient received asa 600mg PR, protonix and
heparin bolus. Heparin drip, clopidogrel and integrelin were not
given because of concern for GI bleed given blood per NGT. She
was sedated with midazolam. She was not responsive and not
moving, but had positive gag and cough. Labs were significant
for a pH of 7.04 with a lactate of 11.8, bicarb 11, and K 3.3.
Head CT showed no acute intracranial process and CXR showed no
acute cardiopulmonary process. Hypothermia pads were placed but
cooling was not started as patient's temperature was 34 degrees
celsius.

- Cardiac catheterization ([**2133-8-10**])-
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction. Systolic function
not
assessed in the cath lab.
3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction involving very distal
LAD,
managed by medical therapy.

- Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2133-8-10**])- The left atrium is
normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal
LV/apical akinesis (difficult to interpret relevance of this
unusual regionality pattern in setting of post cardiac arrest
rescuscitation I.e. given IV epinephrine. CAD versus Takotsubo
CM verusus myocarditis). The basal LV systolic function is
preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


- MRI head w/wo contrast ([**2133-8-12**])- Multiple acute infarcts
found bilaterally in the parietal and occipital lobes, and in
the cerebellar hemispheres. Likely infarcts found bilaterally in
the paramedian frontovertex cortex.  Given the wide distribution
of the infarcts, both supra- and infratentorial and bilateral,
these are likely embolic, from a central source.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
46 yo female with [**Month/Day/Year 3262**] presenting s/p STEMI c/b VF arrest.

Summary of Hospital Course:
# s/p VF arrest:  Patient was down for approximately 20 minutes
prior to return of spontaneous circulation.  Patient was cool on
arrival, and hypothermia protocol was initiated when she arrived
on floor.  She was noted to have a prolonged QT interval on EKG
throughout her stay, and her K+ and Mg+ were frequently repleted
to maintain K>4.5 and Mg>2.5.  She was hypotensive following
rewarming, requiring addition of phenylephrine for pressure
support in addition to milrinone.  EEG showed evidence of status
epilepticus, and she was started on keppra and propofol but
continued to seize and fosphenytoin was added.  An MRI of the
head was performed and showed small areas of infarction
throughout the brain.  Patient was placed in a pentobarbital
coma for 48 hours to suppress seizure activity.  She was
transitioned from milrinone to dopamine and eventually also
required addition of levophed given her poor urine output and
rising creatinine. With the addition of levophed she maintained
MAP in the mid 60s and phenylephrine was successfully weaned
off.
.
Following completion of pentobarbital therapy, she remained
unresponsive with no apprarent brainstem reflexes. She was also
noted to have blown pupils on exam on HD 5. Neurology examined
the patient and noted that she had no sustained brainstem
activity 48 hours after cessation of phenobarb. On HD#7 her HR
and blood pressure declined despite maximum dopamine and
levophed support.  A family meeting was held regarding goals of
care given her poor neurologic prognosis, and the family elected
to withdraw care.  They requested a chaplain to offer a prayer
for the patient and her family.  Her pressors and ventilation
were discontinued.  At 13:40, she passed away with her family at
bedside.  The Medical Examiner's Office accepted the patient for
autopsy, which the family supports.

# s/p STEMI: It is still unclear why this patient suffered an
acute STEMI.  Initial EKG showed large area of myocardium
affected.  Cardiac cath on day of admission showed lesion in the
very distal LAD which was not intervenable.  Urine tox negative
for cocaine.  Significant smoking history. Patient was medically
managed with aspirin, prasugrel, heparin gtt x 48 hrs,
metoprolol, and captopril.  Echocardiogram performed the day of
event showed moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
mid to distal LV/apical akinesis.
.
# Fever/ Leukocytosis: Patient was noted to have temperatures to
99 F in the setting of cooling in addition to an elevated white
blood cell count, increased sputum and urine with a large amount
of sediment.  The patient was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime. Culure of the sputum
Sputum grew MSSA and stenotrophomonas (ceftaz-resistant,
bactrim-sensitive), and urine culture grew citerobacter
(pan-sensitive).  Per ID recommendation patient was started on
IV nafcillin and IV bactrim as she was unable to take PO
medications and could not have levoquin given her long QT.
.
# Diabetes Insipidus: On HD 5 patient was noted to be
hypernatremic with a sodium level of 155. Urine osmolatlity was
low suggesting diabetes insipidus, likely central given her
neurological injury. The patient was given DDAVP 2 mcg IV and
D5W to replete free water with improvement in her hypernatremia.
Sodium remained stable for the remainder of hospitalization.
.
# Transaminitis: The patient was noted to have elevated LFTs on
admission believed to be secondary to poor organ perfusion.
LFTs trended down during hospitalization, but did not return to
normal.
.
#Normocytic anemia: Hematocrit dropped acutely from 27 to 21.1
overnight on HD3.  There were no obvious signs of GI bleed from
rectum or OG tube. Smear showed occasional schistocytes, not
convincing for active hemolysis.  Patient was tranfused 2UPRBCs
on HD4, and hematocrit responded minimally.  Reticulocyte count
was elevated, supporting appropriate bone marrow functioning.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
male, with unknown medical history, who was found down
asystolic.  In the field, the patient had 3 rounds of
epinephrine and atropine followed by return of ventricular
fibrillation rhythm.  He was shocked and then went into PEA.
He was again given epinephrine and atropine with return of
electrical activity and pulse.  The patient has been noted in
the emergency room flow sheets to be pulseless for greater
than 15 minutes in the field.  He was intubated in the field
after multiple failed attempts.

In the emergency room , the patient's blood pressure was
unstable, and he was started on dopamine and eventually
required Levophed as well.  The patient's pupils were fixed
and dilated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient arrived intubated, not
requiring sedation for comfort.  His blood pressure was
maintained with pressor support of dopamine and Levophed.
The patient's pupils were fixed and dilated, and he had no
corneal reflex on admission.  A head CT showed a massive
intracranial hemorrhage.  On admission, the patient's pH was
6.91.  The patient was given bicarb and ventilated, and his
pH on the day of his passing was 7.20 with a PCO2 of 48 and a
PO2 of 72.

The patient's family was notified, and his sisters arrived at
his beside, but did not know any further medical history for
this patient.  The patient's 3 sisters were the closest
relatives, and after discussions with the family, the
decision was made to withdraw pressor support.  Shortly after
withdrawing pressor support, the patient passed away.  The
patient was declared at 2:22 pm on [**2164-4-29**].  The family
refused autopsy and medical examiner declined the case.

DEATH DIAGNOSES:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Asystolic arrest.
3. Respiratory failure.
4. Multiorgan system failure.

History of Present Illness:
62 yo male w/ PMHx significant for HTN, hypercholesterolemia,
DM, CRI, and prior V-fib arrest, presented to the ER w/ sob and
cough.  He has been well until yesterday evening when he had a
cough.  Overnight the patient had an episode on non-bloody
emesis.  Today the patient experienced sob and chills and was
[**Last Name (un) 4662**] to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER.

In triage, the patient had an O2 sat of 68% and a RR of 48.  He
was brought to an ER room and became unresponsive.  He was
bradycardic to the 20's without a pulse.  He was given
epinephrine and chest compressions were started.  The patient
went into a junctional rhythm without a pulse and was given
atropine and intubated shortly thereafter.  A pulse was briefly
regained and then the patient went pulseless again, went into
VT.  Pt was shocked at 200 joules and the pulse was regained.
Amiodarone 300 mg IV push was given.  The patient then entered
sinus rhythm after ~ 5 minutes.

The following day, the patient became febrile to 102.5 and was
pan cultured. Simultaneously, he became less responsive and
rigid, without gag or corneal reflex and sluggish pupils
bilaterally.

Chief Complaint:
Possible PEA Arrest


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 89 yo male with a history of DM2, HTN, slow
AFib, and poor functional capacity who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] after
sustaining a questionable PEA arrest at his opthomologist's
office on [**2145-3-8**]. Per the patient's daughter, after hurrying
him across the road because of oncoming traffic, he acutely
developed lethargy and went to sit down in a hunched over
position. He was apparently unresponsive for 2-3 minutes and
then [**Name8 (MD) **] RN came by and called EMS, which arrived within 3
minutes per the patient's daughter.
.
When EMS arrived, their initial documented HR [**Location (un) 1131**] was a
pulse of 26. After transfer to the stretcher, he was reportedly
pulseless and CPR was initiated (5 min), his monitor reported
pulse in the 20s and he was given atropine for presumed PEA. Per
report, he was also apneic, and hence was intubated int he
field. His HR subsequently rose to 58 and then was 110 on his
arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED (AFib). He was reportedly also agitated
from his intubation.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], his HR was in the 80s. He was started on
propofol gtt (as he was not sedated in the field). His pressure
dropped to 75/25, and his HR dropped to 55. It was presumed that
his BP decrement was due to the bradycardia, and thus was given
atropine and the propofol discontinued. He was given a 2nd mg of
atropine because his HR was still in the 50s; and started on
fentanyl gtt and versed for sedation.

He had a femoral line placed and dopamine infusion was begun b/c
of of BP in the 80s-90s and hr in the 40s.
.
Cardiology was consulted in the ED; he had an ECHO which showed
R heart strain; however, a subsequent PE protocol CT did not
find evidence of an acute PE; evidence of chronic PE was found.
He was intubated for altered mental status and undertook a trip
to the cardiac catheterization laboratory which found him to
have:
- elevated RV and PA pressures.
- he was also started on heparin gtt and given ASA 325.
.
Of note, he was taken off of his ASA for 4 days prior to his
opthamologic surgery. He was also not being anticoagulated for
his known AFib.

5.  Possible interstitial lung disease versus interstitial
engorgement in the setting of recent cardiac arrest.  Followup
imaging may be useful once clinically stabilized.
.
[**3-17**] EEG:
Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized
background and bursts of generalized slowing. These findings
indicate a
widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and
subcortical
structures. Anoxia is a possible explanation of the
encephalopathy.
Medications, infection, and metabolic disturbances can also
contribute.
There were no areas of persistent focal slowing, and there were
no
epileptiform features.


Brief Hospital Course:
(1) POSSIBLE PEA ARREST
From accounts from EMS, it appeared that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a PEA
arrest while running across the street. However, it did not take
long to rescucitate the patient in the field, so it is unclear
whether he had an actual arrest.  Given his chronic PE and high
PA & RV pressures, it is likely that he could not match the
demand from his episode of exertion, leading to hypoxia which
may have been the predisposing factor to his PEA.  In addition,
the patient has poor functional status, and along with his known
CAD and DM, demand ischemia could have potentially led to his
PEA.  Given his CKD and dye load with CTA and right heart cath,
detailed inspection of his coronary anatomy was not pursued.
.
He was continued on aspirin and atrovastatin during his
hospitalization. ECHO showed moderately dilated right ventricle
with moderately depressed function and severe estimated
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

(2) HYPOXIC BRAIN INJURY
Mr.[**Known lastname **] suffered from severe neurologic impairment from his
cardiac event.  Once off sedation for intubation, he was
arousable to voice but otherwise not following commands or
communicating.  Neurology was consulted to advise on progrnosis,
and EEG showed encephalopathy c/w anoxic brain injury.
Neurology felt there was little probability of recovery to
baseline functioning.  The palliative care team was consulted,
and the patient was made comfort measures only on [**2145-3-18**].  On
the morning of [**2145-3-19**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] passed away in the CCU when
his heart went into asystole.

(3) CHRONIC PULMONARY EMBOLISM
Lovenox

(4) ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has long-standing diabetes mellitus with likely CKD,
although baseline creatinine is not known.  Cr was 2.0 on
admission and then 2.3 several days later, likely secondary to
ATN from hypoperfusion during his event and the dye load from
the catheterization and CTA.  Urine output remained good, and
creatinine slowly improved over the hospitalization.

(5) FEVER
Most likely source is pulmonary [**3-13**] aspiration at time of field
intubation; sputum with 3+ GPC and GNR.  He was placed on
vancomycin and zosyn for a seven day course, with improvement in
his fevers.  Blood cultures were negative except for one vial
which grew coag neg Staph, thought to be a contaminant.
Infection/sepsis was not thought to contribute to the immediate
cause of death.

in the left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size are normal.. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focalities. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed LVEF is
35-40%. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid
anterior and anteroseptal hypokinesis, apical anterior
hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic root. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The IABP was repositioned to 2 cm below the LSCA.
POST-CPB: Pt on epi, neo, dobutamine. Preserved LVEF = 35-40%
with wall motion abnormalities as described. During period of
volume resuscitation, there was transient decreased RV systolic
function to mildly depressed with mild TR, improvement was seen
following dobutamine therapy. Mild MR, mild AI as described.
IABP well-positioned below the LSCA. Normal aortic contours
post-decannulation.

INTERPRETED BY: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] W.

FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording the background rhythm
remained
of extremely low voltage such that no clear cortical activity
was
evident, at least for a few seconds at a time. These low voltage
periods were punctuated by high voltage generalized sharp waves
occurring every two to four seconds. The pattern did not vary
over the
course of the recording. There is no apparent response to
external
stimuli. Propofol had been discontinued 20 minutes earlier.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a frequently regular wide complex rhythm
with
some episodes of tachycardia to about 120.
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the profoundly
suppressed background rhythm with no clear cortical activity
evident for
seconds at a time and due to the sharp wave discharges every two
to four
seconds throughout the recording. This finding indicates a
severe
encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical
structures. The
discharges were not so frequent as to suggest seizure activity.
Following over a week after anoxic injury, the recording
suggests a very
poor prognosis.
OBJECT: ANOXIC INJURY AFTER CARDIAC ARREST.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after cardiac arrest and was
taken to the cardiac catheterization lab where it was found that
he had left main and severe 3 vessel disease.  An intra-aortic
balloon pump was inserted and the patient was taken emergently
to the operating room with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] where he underwent a
CABGx5, LIMA-LAD, SVG-Diag, SVG-OM, SVG-PDA, SVG-Diag2.  He
underwent bronchoscopy in the operating room for hypoxia from
presumed aspiration during his arrest.  He was also noted to
have severe epistaxis which was packed by ENT.  Please see
operative note for full details.  He was transfered to the ICU
requiring inotropes and pressors which were weaned off on POD 1.
 His oxygenation gradually improved and his ventillatory support
was weaned down to minimal.  He was noted to be febrile and was
pan-cultured.  He had been placed on antibiotic therapy to cover
for his aspiration.  An neurology consult was obtained on POD1
as he did not regain consciousness when the sedation was weaned
off and was unresponsive to pain.  CT scan showed evidence of
anoxic injury.  Patient developed atrial fibrillation and was
treated with amiodarone and beta blockers.  He continued to have
elevated temperatures with persistently elevated white blood
cell counts.  He had one blood culture that grew coagulase
negative staph and his lines were resited.  He was noted to have
a large amount of sub cutaneous air on POD #2 which and a R
chest tube was placed for a R pneumothorax.  He continued to
have subcutaneous air without further findings of
pneumothoracies, but the patient had multiple broken ribs and
segments of flail chest presumably from his resucitation.  On
POD#4 he was noted to have brief seizure activity and was
started on dilantin.  On POD #8 the family decided to make him
DNR.On POD#10, the family met with the team and neurology, and
it was discused that the patient had a less than 1% chance of
making a meaningful recovery.  It was then decided to extubate
the patient and make him CMO. Pt. expired with family at bedside
on [**2175-8-18**] at 14:34.

Brief Hospital Course:
Femoral central line placed in ED. Insulin drip started. Patient
broadly covered empirically for possible respiratory infection
or sepsis with Vanco/Levo/Zosyn.

Coded in ED. We ordered multiple pressors (dopamine, norepi,
vasopressin) to keep his blood pressure within acceptable
limits. Phenylephrine added during his time in the CCU.

Multiple codes (primarily PEA/asystole) while in CCU. Patient
continued to be unresponsive with pupils fixed and dilated.
Family called, plans of care discussed. Early in admission,
patient had been stabilized, family felt full code was
appropriate because patient was so recently s/p transplant and
had been doing well. After family had gone home, patient coded
again (PEA) and family was called back. Attending ([**Doctor Last Name **])
discussed evolving situation and worsening prognosis with wife
and son. Wife in room s/p resuscitation, witnessed ongoing
efforts to stabilize and treat patient.

After several additional codes including many chest compressions
and courses of ACLS medications appropriate to evolving rhythms,
patient's wife agreed that resuscitation efforts should be
suspended if situation did not improve. Patient continued to
re-enter PEA/asystole, and soon expired. Family asked for
autopsy without brain findings in order to find out what had led
to patient's relatively sudden death.

s/p PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation, DM2, prior
MI presents s/p PEA arrest at an OSH after VATS.
.
Patient is intubated and unresponsive on arrival, history is
obtained from outside records.
.
In early [**Month (only) 359**], he had a sore throat and felt poorly. He went
to his PCP and was treated with 10 days of ammoxicillin. he then
was treated with penicillin for a dental extraction. Shortly
after this, he became progressively short of breath. He saw his
PCP who referred him to Cardiology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77919**]. At that
time a CXR was performed that showed opacification of the right
lower [**12-9**] to [**12-8**] hemithorax, interpreted as infiltrate + pleural
effusion. He also had a stress echocardiogram and a cardiac
catheterization was planned. A chest X-ray was repeated on
[**2126-10-28**], which was unchanged. His cath was deferred and he was
scheduled to undergo VATS with possible pleural decortication.
.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 26615**] on [**2126-10-30**] for VATS and
bronchoscopy. 2600 cc of straw colored pleural fluid was
removed, and pleural biopsy was taken. At the end of the
procedure, prior to extubation, patient had a drop in blood
pressure and suffered a PEA arrest. Patient received
defibrillation, epinephrine, and chest compresions for 17
minutes. He returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm, and was transferred
to the ICU. He was put on a lasix drip. There an echo
demonstrated no pericardial effusion, and and CT PA demonstrated
no PE. His labs were significant for a WBC of 12. Cardiac
enzymes were flat. He was treated with levaquin and unasyn for
presumed PNA. He was weaned off of sedation and only responded
to noxious stimuli. He was evaluated by neurology who
recommended MRI and EEG. He is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
cardiology and neurology evaluation. On transfer, he was on a
heparin drip, midazolam/fentanyl for sedation and mechanical
ventilation (AC).

EEG: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a
low-voltage background that was invariant and nonreactive to
external
stimulation. This finding suggests a diffuse and severe
encephalopathy,
such as that caused by hypoxic-ischemic injury, toxic-metabolic
changes,
or medication effect, among other things. There were no focal
abnormalities or epileptiform features noted.
.
PCXR: The ET tube tip is 5.2 cm above the carina. The NG tube
tip passes below the diaphragm with its tip being in the
stomach.
Diffuse pericardial calcification is noted, circumferential.
Mediastinum is minimally widened but it might be related to
portable technique of the study.  There is minimal vascular
congestion but no overt edema. Left retrocardiac opacity might
represent area of atelectasis, aspiration or infectious process
and should be closely monitored.
.
TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior, inferolateral,
and anterolateral hypokinesis. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, additional focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40%). Unable to assess left ventricular
diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.
.
MR HEAD W/ and W/O CON:
1. Extensive confluent areas of decreased diffusion in the
bilateral parietal and occipital [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] and parts of the frontal
lobes likely related to cortical infarction with some degree of
cortical swelling. Spreading of the temporal lobes, the basal
ganglia and the right cerebellar hemisphere and probably the
left cerebellar hemisphere. Correlate clinically and consider
followup/correlation with brain scan.
2. Area of increased signal intensity on the T2 and FLAIR
sequences in the
right frontal [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] relate to changes in the parenchyma
surrounding small developmental venous anomaly. However, given
the lack of prior studies and the extent of FLAIR hyperintense
area, which measures 2.1 x 2.6 cm, consider followup to assess
stability/progression to exclude any associated low-grade
neoplasm.
3. Mucosal thickening in the mastoid air cells on both sides,
right more than left.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. s/p PEA arrest. Post-op/peri anesthesia hypotension most
likely precipitant of PEA. Possible contribution from hypoxia
given lung collapse seen on CT. CT PA negative for PE, echo
negative for tamponade. Labs essentially normal, cardiac enzymes
negative. Neurology consulted and EEG and MRI head done, all
consistent with very poor neurologic prognosis. Neurology team
explained prognosis to patient's family and they agreed that it
would not be within his wishes to exist without meaningful
interaction. NEOB was initially contact[**Name (NI) **] but pt. was no longer
a possible donor once extubated.
.
# Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion: Patient was never
extubated post-thoracentesis. Continued levaquin and unasyn
given concern for aspiration/oral flora given unilateral PNA,
recent tooth extraction and alcohol history. Pleural fluid
analysis not an empyema, but suggestive of exudate. Fluid
cytology negative. Patient was overbreathing vent with excellent
RSBI prior to extubation. He was made DNR/DNI prior to
extubation. He was successfully extubated on [**11-4**] and morphine
drip was given with scopolamine patch for comfort measures. He
expired on the morning of [**11-6**]. Autopsy was requested by the
family.

Brief Hospital Course:
# s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial
PEA arrest. No anticedent illness. No e/o ischemia on EKG.
Anticoagulated so unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided
pneumothorax with no e/o tension prior to arrival. No e/o
hypovolemia. With profound acidosis. Thus, unclear but
potentially primary cardiac vs pulmonary source.
Patient underwent cooling protocol. The cardiac arrest team,
including neuro, was involved. Patient was monitored on
continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol. EEG on [**2159-7-30**] showed
some higher amplitude spikes, but since early morning of [**2159-7-31**],
EEG was flatline. Neuro felt that there was very little hope of
significant recovery of brain function. Patient also continued
to require moderately high doses of levophed and dopamine to
maintain blood pressure.
Family meeting was held [**2159-7-31**] with CCU team, neurology consult,
SW. Family agreed that CMO would be in line with patient's
wishes. Patient was extubated and all medications stopped.
Patient received morphine prn for comfort.
.
# Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to
ventilate with high auto PEEP, PIP. Patient with h/o asthma and
concern for bronchospasm on exam. No h/o COPD per available
records. Patient received Albuterol / Ipratroprium nebs prn,
daily CXR were followed.
.
# CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG. No localized ischemia on ECGs,
no elevation in enzymes.

# PUMP: No prior records in our system, family cannot relay any
clear details.
.
# RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity
leading to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none
since. Patient therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Patient was
monitored on telemetry.

History of Present Illness:
46 y/o male w/ PHMx HCV, opioid/benzo abuse who was found down
at home earlier today.  He was recently hospitalized from
[**Date range (1) 108693**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure felt secondary to a
multifocal pneumonia with septic shock.  He completed a course
of vanco/zosyn/levo while in house - problems also consisted of
shock liver and [**Last Name (un) **], both of which were improving on discharge.
A note from his PCP was listed in OMR on [**12-21**] that states he was
complaining of  unrelenting headache and posterior neck and
upper back pain - there is a mention of chronic headache that
was used for drug seeking behavior and the PCP did not provide
opioid therapy.  It is unclear who found him or how long he was
down but he was intubated by EMS immediately on arrival.  There
was suspicion for a heroin overdose with aspiration as food was
found in the orophraynx - narcan was administered without
result.  While EMS was on the scene, he went into VF arrest and
was pulseless for 30 minutes prior to ROSC.  He underwent CPR
and received 1 shock with return of pulse in the ED.  .
.
In the ED, initial VS were:
Chest xray showed right middle/lower lobe infiltrate c/w
atelectasis or aspiration. CT head showed possible signs of
cerebral edema.  Given the VF, he was given a procainamide bolus
followed by gtt.  Cardiology was consulted who felt this was
likely not from ischemic cardiac disease and cath would not be
helpful at this time.  A femoral triple lumen catheter was
placed.  Post-arrest team consulted and patient started on
therapeutic hypothermia protocol with Arctic Sun - sedated with
fent/midaz and paralyzed with cisatracurium.  He was on max dose
levophed and phenylephrine in the ED, but these were able to be
weaned prior to transfer.  Labs notable for WBC 32.6 (band 1,
N78), plt 654, Cr 4.1, bicarb 17, K 6.4 (hemolyzed specimen).

CT HEAD [**12-22**]
1. No evidence of hemorrhage, large vessel infarction, or shift
of the
normally midline structures.
2. The sulci do not appear prominent for a patient this age.
While this may be a normal finding in a relatively young patient
without atrophy, the patient's clinical history elevates
suspicion for cerebral edema. As a result, continued followup is
recommended.

CXR [**12-22**]
Evaluation is limited due to overlying trauma backboard.
Endotracheal tube is high, the tip is 7.1 cm above the carina.
An enteric
tube is visualized traversing through the stomach with tip out
of the field of view. There is prominence of the pulmonary
vasculature consistent with increased central venous pressure.
Additionally, there is a focal opacity overlying the right
middle and lower lobes suggestive of atelectasis, possibly due
to aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15427**] is a 46y/o gentleman with HCV, opioid/benzo abuse,
recent admission for multifocal PNA c/b hypercarbic resp failure
with septic shock who was found down for an unclear amount of
time, had Vfib arrest and was intubated & initiated on
therapeutic hyperthermia for neuroprotection.  The etiology of
his Vfib arrest was unclear; MI was unlikely.  Drug overdose
possible.

His course was marked by profound mixed acidosis, kidney injury,
leukocytosis on broad-spectrum antibiotics.  After he was
rewarmed and his sedation was weaned off, his exam revealed loss
of many brainstem reflexes.  EEG suggested sequelae of anoxic
brain injury.  Family meeting was held, and the decision was
made to withdraw care.  He expired on [**2159-12-24**].

History of Present Illness:
76 yo M with a history of CAD, PVD, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus II and chronic kidney disease
admitted after becoming unresponsive at home.
.
The patient complained to his family of fatigue for the past
week. On the evening prior to his event he developed chills. The
patient said to his family that he felt as if he was coming down
with an illnes (""the flu"") and he went to bed early. At 6:30AM
on the day of admission, the patient descended the stairs to the
living room in his house where his wife witnessed him having
difficulty breathing, described as ""raspy"" by his wife. The
patient did not respond to repeated questioning by his wife
about how he was feeling. The patient sat down on the couch then
laid his head on the arm of the couch and became unresponsive.
His wife called her daughter and then 911. The patient was
unresponsive for up to 30 minutes by his wife's report prior to
CPR being initiated by EMS.
.
The patient was found to be asystolic by EMT. He received
atropine 1mg x3 and epinephrine 1mg with return of pulse in
rapid a fib and pressure 60/palp. He was intubated in the field
and started on peripheral dopamine. On arrival to the ED, pulse
96, bp 140/56.
.
In the ED, the patient was found to have hyperkalemia and severe
metabolic acidosis (pH 6.7). He received 2amps calcium
gluconate, insulin and D50, 2 amps sodium bicarb and kayexalate
as treatment for hyperkalemia. He was changed from a dopamine to
levophed gtt, started on a versed gtt and heparin gtt. He
underwent CTA which was negative for PE or aortic abnormality.
He received 3 amps sodium bicarb in D5 and mucomyst prophylaxis
in advance of possible cardiac cartheterization. Catheterization
was deferred in the setting of profound acidosis.
.
Review of systems is notable for no cardiac complaints with the
exception of his apparent shortness of breath. He had no CP,
N/V, dizziness, lightheadedness, presyncope, edema, orthopnea.
The family denies recent fevers or cough. His wife states that
the patient recently complained of gout-type symptoms in his big
toe. No report of dysarthria or gait disturbances, headache or
blurry vision.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 76 yo M with a history of CAD, PVD, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus II and chronic kidney disease
admitted after becoming unresponsive at home found to have a
cardiac arrest now with profound metabolic acidosis.
.
# Unresponsiveness/Arrest. Unclear of underlying etiology. The
patient was found in a cardiac arrest (PEA) successfully
resucitated. This seems unlikely to be of primary cardiac
etiology with non-diagnostic EKG changes and modest cardiac
enzyme elevations. Sepsis as a preceding etiology seems possible
given report of infectious-type symptoms including fatigue and
chills the evening prior to his event. Infection and relative
hypovolemia precipitating acute on chronic renal failure as an
etiology for uremia/acidosis and hyperkalemia is also possible.
A CVA is possible but unlikely. CTA negative for PE or aortic
abnormality. Prolonged period (30 minutes) unresponsive prior to
rescucitation and profound metabolic acidosis portend a poor
prognosis. Patient uderwent Cooling protocol and agressive BP
control.

Patient continued to deteriorate with hyperkalemia and
progressing renal failure, exhibiting signs of profound
neurologic impairment. Goal of care were re-adressed with
family, who reported patient's wishes were to not have dialysis
or life support. Patient was made comfort measures only in the
morning of [**2166-2-14**].

Patient was extubated with family at the bedside; time of death
12:50pm [**2166-2-14**].

Patient had tested positive for the Influenza Virus.

Intubation with endotracheal tube

History of Present Illness:
87yo F with a history of dementia, afib, COPD (on home O2)
presented from nursing home with dyspnea and respiratory
distress.
.
The patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED from NH and found to
have oxygen saturations in the 80s. She was initially given
non-invasive ventilation, which she did not tolerate well, so
she was intubated and sedated. Shortly thereafter, she was
bradycardic to the 40s and then went into PEA arrest. CPR was
initiated and the patient received epinephrine x 2, bicarbonate
and calcium chloride. She underwent 15 minutes of CPR and
regained a pulse. Chest x-ray was concerning for a possible
pneumothorax on the left so she underwent needle decompression
with subsequent bilateral chest tube placement. A significant
amount of fluid came out (right- blood, left, transudate). A
femoral line was placed and the patient was started on triple
pressors (dopamine, levophed and neosynephrine). Post-arrest
team evaluated the patient and recommended therapeutic
hypothermia if blood pressures were stable, which was not the
case in the ED. CTA demonstrated large left-sided PE. She was
sent to the MICU for further management.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was intubated and
unresponsive. Her daughter, [**Name (NI) 8513**] (HCP) was called and stated
the patient would not want heroic measures performed and to
transition to comfort care only. We discussed that this meant
extubating the patient and removing all pressors as well as
starting a morphine drip for pain control, which the health care
proxy agrees with. She states the patient has been unhappy for
the past few years and would not want live like this. Her
nursing home states that the patient expressed that she would
like to be allowed to die peacefully but there was no official
DNR/DNI status outlined by her [**Hospital3 2558**] physician.

Brief Hospital Course:
PEA arrest- likely secondary to PE. Patient s/p CPR for 15
minutes where she received epinephrine x 2, bicarbonate and
calcium chloride in the ED. She was on placed on 3 pressors
(dopamine, levophed and neosynephrine) and sent to the MICU. HCP
was [**Name (NI) 653**] and was explicit in that the patient would not
want these ""heroic"" measures performed and wants to focus on
comfort care only. She is aware that this means that the patient
would be extubated and pressors would be discontinued. Patient
would be started on morphine for comfort purposes. HCP
(daughter) is understanding and all questions were answered.  Pt
was extubated and pressors were discontinued. She was started on
a morphine gtt for comfort. Pt expired shortly after.

Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive, cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CPR, intubation

History of Present Illness:
87 year old man with a history of CAD s/p MI and stent, bladder
carcinoma in situ, who presents from nursing home found to be
unresponsive and found to be in cardiac arrest. Per collateral
history, he was receiving treatment for a UTI with ciprofloxacin
and azithromycin but otherwise in his usual state of health when
he was found to be unresponsive this morning at his nursing
home. EMS was called and CPR was initiated in the field. An
intraosseous line was placed and he was intubated and CPR was
initiated. CPR was continued for 30 minutes with one round of
ACLS achieved at nursing home. He arrived to the ED undergoing
chest compressions.
.
In the ED, he was found to have a pH 6.94/83/329, and lactate of
14.6, and HCT of 19.7, INR of 3.7, PLTs of 47. A nonsterile
femoral line was placed. 2 chest tubes were placed bilaterally
for emperic PTX treatment. A bedside echo was done by cardiology
which was apparently unremarkable. He was given 1gm epinephrine
boluses 7 times, 2 amps of sodium bicarbonate, and was started
on a levophed gtt, dopamine gtt, neosynephrine gtt, and
epinephrine gtt, and he was given 3L of NS, and 1 unit of blood
hanging. He lost his pulse twice, second time at 1115 but
responded to one last round of epi, making a total of 8 rounds.
His last set of vitals 130/90 HR 80s 100% on vent 15, FIO2 100%,
PEEP 5, Rate of 20.
.
In the MICU, he arrives intubated, sedated and with a pulse. His
initial vitals were BP 107/40, HR 60. Given the patient's
advanced age, lactate of 14.6, pH of 6.94, tenous blood
pressures despite 4 pressors, the MICU team has decided to not
escalate care and deem his code status as DNR/DNI as CPR is not
indicated. He was given 3L of NS, 2 unit of PRBCs.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old man with a history of CAD s/p MI and stent, bladder
carcinoma in situ, who presents from nursing home found to be
unresponsive and found to be in cardiac arrest.  Most likely
etiology of PEA was hypovolemic blood loss given presenting HCT
of 19.7 which is 20 points down from baseline (down from 37 on
[**2155-6-17**] per nsg home records). Would consider blood loss from
bladder CA/hematuria history, vs occult GI bleed. Consider QT
prolongation from recent cipro vs aspiration PNA/hypoxia as
other etiologies. Patient initially with an extremely poor
prognosis, with a lactate of 14.6, pH of 6.94, on four pressors
and MAPs of 50s, incompatible with life and consistent with
diffuse cell death.  Urgent family meeting was held and decision
was made to make the patient DNR/DNI.  He expired shortly
thereafter with family at bedside.  Patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**].

History of Present Illness:
32 yo M with PMH of alcohol abuse who is admitted s/p asysolic
arrest at home.
.
Per his family, around 8:45pm last night they heard a thump and
found the patient face down in the bathroom.  Bystander CPR was
started immediately and EMS arrived 5 minutes later.  He was
found to be in asystole. He was collared, boarded, intubated and
ACLS initiated. Per cardiology fellow note, on route to OSH, EKG
showed torsades at 9:07 s/p shock into VF/VT. In total, he
received 3 of Epi enroute to [**Hospital1 **] and was asystolic on arrival
there at 21:21.  He was intubated, not sedated and was comatose
on arrival with no voluntary movements and fixed and dilated
pupils.  He received 3 epi, 2 atropine 1 of bicarb and was
reportedly briefly in PEA, followed by VF and afib with ""diffuse
ischemia"" by 21:24.  He was started on lidocaine gtt at that
time, followed for neo gtt for systolic blood pressures in the
60s. By 22:00 he was in sinus tachycardia.  The multiple EKGs
from [**Hospital1 **] reveal a lot of baseline artifact but 21:48 reveals
sinus tach with STE in AVR, V1 with diffuse st depressions
inferolaterally.  Labs there signifcant for trop <0.06, WBC 12,
h/H  11.6/35.6, K4.5 and Creat 0.9.  AST 412ALT 160.  Mg was not
ordered.   The arctic protocol was initiated and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were BP 169/117, HR 120, RR 22,
O2 sat 100% on RA. Patient was unresponsive off sedation and
hypertensive even off neo. Temperature was 34 degrees at 23:50.
He received 2 grams of magnesium and 100 thiamine. Initial labs
showed a hct of 35.9 with a MCV of 101, WBC of 7.3. Urine and
serum tox were negative. LFTs were notable for ALT 254, AST 859,
AP 248, Tbili 1.7. Lactate was 12. 5, CK was 782, troponin 0.04.
ABG showed pH7.30 pCO230 pO2>600 HCO315, with repeat lactate of
8.6. CT head showed occipital sub-galeal hemorrhage and loss of
the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter distinction suggestive of anoxic brain
injury. CT torso showed rib fractures anteriorly but no acute
intra-abdominal process. He was seen by the cardiac arrest team
who recommended inducing hypothermia to 33 degrees, elevating
HOB to >30 degrees to minimize ICP and keeping pCO2 around
35-45. He was then seen by cardiology who recommending d/c-ing
the lidocaine drip. He was admitted to the CCU for further
management. His vital signs on transfer were BP 198/134 HR84
RR23 O2 sat 100% on AC ventilation. He has 2IOs and 2PIVs for
access.
.
In the CCU, patient was intubated and unresponsive.

IMAGING:
[**2161-4-22**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2161-4-22**] CXR: Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.

[**2161-4-22**] TTE: The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe global hypokinesis with evidence
of spontaneous echo contrast in left ventricle. No significant
valvular abnormality seen.

[**2161-4-22**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due
to the presence of a burst suppression pattern, with runs of
high amplitude fast activity, occurring at a 0.5-1 Hz
periodicity, in runs up to 8 seconds, separated by extremely
prolonged periods of suppression up to 2 minutes. This pattern
is consistent with a severe diffuse encephalopathy, likely
secondary to hypothermia. However, as the patient is being
rewarmed,
the bursts gradually become lower voltage and the interburst
intervals
shorten, indicating a worsening encephalopathy. This pattern is
seen
after severe diffuse hypoxic injury, and portends a poor
prognosis.
There are no epileptiform features seen.

[**2161-4-22**] CT HEAD: 1. Poor [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation, diffusely,
which, in the setting of cardiac arrest, is very concerning for
global hypoxic-ischemic injury.

2. No hemorrhage.

3. Large occipital scalp subgaleal hematoma, with diffuse edema
in the
extracranial soft tissues.

[**2161-4-22**] CT Torso: 1. No acute findings to explain the patient's
decompensation. 2. Fatty liver without focal lesions identified.
3. Pulmonary atelectasis.

[**2161-4-23**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due
to the presence of a burst suppression pattern, with runs of
bursts of low voltage theta activity, separated by extremely
prolonged periods of suppression up to 1 minute. As the patient
is being rewarmed, the bursts gradually become lower voltage,
and the interburst intervals lengthen indicating a worsening
encephalopathy. This pattern is consistent with severe diffuse
encephalopathy, likely secondary to the patients known history
of severe diffuse hypoxic injury, and portends an extremely poor
prognosis. Between 1 pm and 5:30 pm, there is significant
shivering artifact. There are no epileptiform features seen. The
study is discontinued at 7:30 pm.

Brief Hospital Course:
32 year old M with history of alcohol abuse found down s/p
asystolic cardiac arrest.
.
# S/P Cardiac Arrest: Patient found asystolic in the field with
ROSC after ACLS. Initial rhythm strips were suggestive of
torsades and patient's EKG showed a long QT (between 460 and 490
depending on the rate and EKG). Cooling was started at the OSH,
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. On arrival, was
unresponsive and comatose in absence of sedating agents, with CT
head suggestive of global anoxic injury. Cooling process was
continued at [**Hospital1 18**], but EEG protended poor prognosis. He was
seen by EP and neurology. EP deferred futher workup and
evaluation pending neurologic recovery. Patient was rewarmed per
protocol and repeat EEG consistent with severe diffuse
encephalopathy, likely secondary to the patients known history
of severe diffuse hypoxic injury, portending an extremely poor
prognosis. Neurology felt that pending re-evaluation after
rewarming he would be brain dead. A family meeting was held, and
the patient's family decided to terminally extubate the patient.
He expired shortly thereafter.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred to the CCU because the cause of the
patient's cardiac arrest was unclear. A TTE showed normal EF and
a very small pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade. A
CTA was negative for PE and only showed small bilateral
atelectasis and the known goiter. Tox screens were negative. A
head CT showed global loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation, which
was concerning for edema related to ischemia. The patient was
started on mannitol. EEG showed frequent discharges c/w either
non-convlusive status or periodic epileptiform discharges with
suppression pattern. A pentobarb coma was initiated because of
failure of dilantin and phenobarbitol to suppress this activity.
Her care was transferred to the MICU team given her normal CV
status.

In consultation with [**Doctor Last Name **], the patient's prognosis for any
meaningful recovery was deemed to be very poor. After several
family meetings with members of the ICU team, her PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **], nurses, and social worker/case management, the
decision was made by the family to withdraw care. Given the
patient's wishes to be an organ donor, the patient received
30,000U of heparin IV at the time of extubation on [**2186-7-17**]. The
patient expired at 1356 on [**2186-7-17**].

Date of Birth:   [**2092-3-27**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year-old female
with coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2153**] and multiple percutaneous interventions
who was brought to the Emergency Department after a witnessed
cardiac arrest.  The patient was in the mall and had a
witness cardiac arrest.  There was bystander CPR at two
minutes and after eight minutes an AED arrived and the
patient was shocked.  CPR continued for five to six minutes
and then EMS arrived.  Initial rhythm was complete heart
block and the patient was treated with epinephrine.  This led
to ventricular tachycardia and the patient was shocked
leading to a rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, which
converted to sinus rhythm after two further shocks.
Electrocardiogram showed inferior ST elevations and lateral
ST depressions.  The patient was intubated and brought to the
Emergency Department.  In the Emergency Department she was
treated with heparin and Integrilin, but this was
discontinued due to coffee ground emesis.  A chest x-ray
showed a right pneumothorax and a chest tube was placed.  The
patient became hypotensive and Dobutamine and Levophed were
started for blood pressure support.  The patient was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit and the pressors were
weaned off with fluid boluses.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.
3.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2153**], multiple PCIs and a redo coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2163**].
4.  Bladder prolapse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Pulse 100 to 120.  Blood
pressure 60 to 80/40 to 60.  Oxygen saturation 86 to 90% on
the ventilator.  Her heart was regular with no murmurs.
There were rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally.  The
abdomen was benign and there was no edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit status post cardiac arrest and resuscitation.  The
main concern of the family from the time of admission was the
patient's wishes regarding end of life care and previous
discussions suggesting that she wished not to be intubated or
resuscitated.  After extensive discussions with the family it
was determined to give the patient 48 hours to determine,
which direction her neurologic status would go.  The
neurology consult team followed throughout the
hospitalization and while she initially showed some positive
signs by [**12-1**] it appeared that the patient was not
going to make a rapid recovery back to her baseline
functional status as she would have wished.  Additionally the
patient's respiratory status was compromised both by right
pneumothorax secondary to rib fracture sustained during CPR
as well as probable aspiration pneumonia.  On [**12-2**]
another meeting with the patient's two sons and daughter was
held.  They believed firmly that it would be their mother's
wishes to withdraw care as she never wished to have her life
sustained with heroic measures.  Therefore in the afternoon
of [**12-2**] the patient's mechanical ventilation was
discontinued and she quickly had a respiratory arrest.  The
patient was pronounced dead at 2:40 p.m.  The family declines
postmortem examination.

Brief Hospital Course:
76yo M with PMH of DM, HTN, known CAD presented s/p VF arrest.

1) Cardiac:

-- Ventricular fibrillation arrest:
Pt became unresponsive while being bathed by his visiting nurse.
Once found at the scene  Pt found to be in Ventricluar
fibrillation and was delivered shock, then a period of asystole,
given epinephrine, period of PEA, then perfusing rhythm. Labs on
arrival were notable for arterial pH 7.04, Trop T 2.35, Lactate
8.8, INR >22, K 6.0, Dig 2.2, Cr 4.8. He was started on Dopamine
drip in in the emergency department for SBP's in 70's. EKG on
admission did not reveal any ST segment changes indicative of
acute ischemia.

Etiology of the VF arrest was considered secondary to acute
infarct, possibly occurring several days prior to admission
accounting for elevation in troponin enzymes. DC cardioversion
alone was considered unlikely to account for early peak in
Troponin enzymes found on admission. Pt also had hyperkalemia ?
secondary to GI bleeding in setting of supratherapeutic INR.
Echocardiogram on admission was limited due to poor windows. The
left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated. Estimated left
ventricular ejection fraction was ~40%. There was probable mid
to distal septal and apical hypokinesis/akinesis (these regions
may also be thinned but could not be fully  visualized). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were normal. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The mitral valve
appeared structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There was no pericardial effusion.

Patient required dopamine infusion to maintain systolic blood
pressures. This was weaned on hospital day #3. The patient
remained in normal sinus rhythm off pressors for the remaining
duration of the hospitalization.

2) Neurological-
On morning of admission the pt withdrew all four extremities to
pain, had an intact gag reflex, but was otherwise without
pupillary reflexes (pt has poor visual acuity at baseline), no
corneal reflex, no response to nasal septal stimulation.
Neurology consultation was obtained. Two hours later the patient
was noted to have generalized tonic-clonic seizure-like activity
in all four extremities. EEG monitoring confirmed spike and wave
discharge consistent with epileptiform activity with severe
background suppression. These discharges were thought secondary
to anoxic brain injury. The patient was given phenytoin load and
maintenance dosing for supression of motor activity with
seizures, Midazolam drip was also utilized for seizure control.
Continued EEG monitoring revealed status epilepticus despite
medical therapy. Pentobarbital coma was offered, but declined by
the family given extremely poor prognosis for meaningful
neurological recovery from acute anoxic brain injury sustained
during the patient's VF arrest.

After extensive discussion with pt's family and health care
proxy, and no indication of neurological improvement after one
week of supportive care, the patient was started on a morphine
drip and terminally extubated. The patient expired 1 hour later
surrounded by his family.

3) Acute Renal [**Name (NI) 37370**]
Pt was anuric for first 3 days of admission with gradually
rising BUN, Cr, K+ values. Family did not wish to start
dialysis. Pt then became oliguric, and then began autodiuresing
on HD #4 presumably from resolving ATN.

Chief Complaint:
respiratory arrest, followed by cardiac arrest


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line placement
arterial line placement
intubation

History of Present Illness:
61yo male who presents from a nursing home after a choking
episode causing respiratory, then PEA arrest. He reportedly has
a history of dysphagia (on chronic soft mechanical diet) and
COPD. The patient was in the cafeteria when he suffered a
choking event on a piece of steak. He went into respiratory
distress and EMS was called. On EMS arrival the patient was
breathing spontaenously but with difficulty and was diaphoretic.


During EMS transport the patient stopped breathing and lost
pulses. Per EMS initially in asystole. Underwent immediate CPR
and ACLS protocol with epi x3. No shocks. Total downtime 0min.
Total low flow 10min with ROSC. Intubated prior to arrival by
EMS, per report a steak peice was removed. No sedation given for
intubation. ECG on arrival showed inferior ST depressions and ST
depression V3-6. Patient was pulseless in narrow complex rhythm
initially. Chest compressions were continued for another one to
two minutes while access was obtained, airway secured, and on
repeat pulse check, patient had palpable pulses, blood pressure
at that time was 85 systolic. Patient began to gag
spontaneously, once hemodynamic stability was demonstrated (~15
minutes after ROSC), he was placed on sedation as he was
overbreathing the ventilator, though no other purposeful
movements in that brief interlude.

In the ED:
ETT was confirmed with direct laryngoscopy
EKG showed sinus tach, ns stw dep inferiolaterally
CXR showed some edema, ? rib fractures, possible aspiration, OG
tube placement was confirmed.
Vanc and Zosyn were given for aspiration pneumonia
He was guaiac negative
Shock ultrasound unrevealing of any immediately reversible signs
of shock
The post-arrest team was consulted, who said that cooling
indicated at this time, after head CT, which was grossly
negative
Pressures initially up to 130/60, then down with
Fentanyl and Versed for sedation
Has an 18G and 16G for access
Received about 2L of IV fluids

On arrival to the MICU, patient intubated and sedated. Unable to
obtain recent ROS. Per his court-appointed guardian, he has been
falling a lot, but is generally pretty happy-go lucky.
Completely conversant with good cognitive function. He was at
[**Hospital **] Hospital and no nursing home would accept without a
guardian, so he ended up with a guardian. They were never able
to discuss in any depth what he would want done if he were
critically ill. Was a 'go with the flow' type [**Male First Name (un) **], agreeable.

Per [**Hospital3 2558**], at baseline he is oriented to self only and
wheelchair bound. He has had problems with eating, and is
supposed to get a mechanical soft diet. He got antibiotics in
[**Month (only) 547**] but has otherwise been at baseline.

CT head
1.  No acute intracranial process.
2.  Mild global atrophy.
.
EEG
This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because
of severe diffuse encephalopathy initially with a marked
suppression and
burst pattern. This evolved into a much more frequent bursting
pattern
associated with systemic myoclonus and a continued severe
suppression of
electrical activity between these bursts. This is a pattern
compatible
with post-anoxic myoclonic seizure activity.
.
ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
25 %) secondary to extensive anteroapical akinesis with focal
apical dyskinesis. Only the basal segments of the left ventricle
display preserved contractile function. A moderate sized
crescent-shaped apical thrombus is seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The aortic valve is not well seen. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: extensive anteroapical left ventricular contractile
dysfunction with an apical aneurysm and apical thrombus


Brief Hospital Course:
80yo male with history of dysphagia, admitted after PEA arrest
in the setting of a choking episode. Patient completed cooling
protocol and found to have poor neurologic function. He was
subsequently transitioned to comfort measures only and passed
away on [**2175-6-13**].

# Acute respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia: Patient
presented with acute respiratory failure in the setting of a
choking event. CXR showed evidence of underlying process
consistent with aspiration. On admission he was started on
vancomycin and zosyn. He was extubated on [**6-10**]. Antibiotics were
discontinued with transtion to comfort measures on [**6-11**].

# s/p PEA arrest: The most likely etiology is hypoxemia in the
setting of choking episode. Patient had RoSC after 10 minutes of
low flow. Given [**Location (un) 2611**] coma score <10 after resuscitation,
patient met criteria for therapeutic cooling. He completed the
cooling protocol on [**6-8**] and was rewarmed on [**6-9**]. His post
arrest TTE showed depressed LVEF and an LV thrombus. No
anticoagulation was started.

# Coma post-cardiac arrest: at baseline he is orientated x 2.
Initially it was difficult to assess his neurologic status in
the setting of cooling and sedation. He was monitored for 48
hours after rewarming and discontinuation of sedation and
continued to be unresponsive with only some brainstem reflexes
on exam. He was monitored on continuous EEG which demonstrated
myoclonic epileptiform activity. The Neurology team was
consulted given concern for seizures. The EEG showed evidence of
severe, diffuse, and irreversible anoxic brain injury. He was
started on Keppra [**Hospital1 **] which was discontinued on transition to
comfort care.

# Goals of care: Given the information noted above, Mr. [**Known lastname **]
overall prognosis was grim and the likelihood of meaningful
neurologic recovery was negligible. A consensus between two
attending physicians and the MICU team was reached that Mr. [**Known lastname **]
did not have a change of meaningful neurologic recovery and
therefore aggressive care would not be appropriate in his case.
He was subsequently transitioned to comfort focused care. His
guardian was notified of this plan, and Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on
palliative treatment with a morphine drip for comfort and ativan
for seizures. He was also given IV tylenol for fevers. Mr. [**Known lastname **]
died comfortably on [**2175-6-13**] at 12:34 AM.

History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2143**]
(SVG-LCx, LIMA-LAD), redo in [**2152**] (SVG>PDA) with AVR,
constrictive pericarditis, type 1 DM who presents from home
after PEA arrest. History is obtained from his assistant.
Patient had been in his usual state of health this morning
according to his daughter and assistant. At 1245 he ambulated
from the kitchen to the bathroom and complained of shortness of
breath. He sat down in the chair to rest, turned red then white
and was gasping for breath. He then slumped in the chair and
became unresponsive. 911 was called and reportedly arrived
within 3-5 minutes. According to the ED report, patient had
initial rhythm of PEA. CPR was initiated and patient was then
noted to be in VT. He was given epinephrine, atropine and
lidocaine and converted to sinus tach with BP 120. Patient was
brought to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to the ED, BP was 68/41. He was intubated and started
on Amiodarone gtt and Levophed. EKG showed atrial fibrillation
with STE in aVR, V1 with STD in II, III, V3-V6. Initial labs
notable for lactate of 5.1, creatinine 1.4, CK 1119, MB 10 and
troponin 0.09. ABG was 7.19/43/453. He was taken emergently to
cath lab and found to have patent LIMA and vein grafts. He had a
stenosis of his distal LAD treated with balloon angioplasty.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient is intubated with good
oxygenation. He arrives on amiodarone gtt, off of all pressors.
HR 80s in atrial fibrillation, BP 140-150s/80s. He is noted to
have mild facial twitching bilaterally. He is unresponsive off
of sedation.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**Month (only) **] for
bradycardia. He was admitted to OSH on [**2156-10-9**] s/p fall and
noted to have STE in aVR. Troponins elevated to 0.53, CKMB 28.6.
Cath with BMS x2 to left main, given amiodarone for atrial
ectopy and diuresed for heart failure. He was then admitted to
[**Hospital1 2025**] on [**10-20**] with bradycardia attributed to amiodarone and
improved without other interventions.
.
Patient has 24 hour care at home. At baseline he is dyspneic
with minimal exertion and reportedly progressively worse over
recent months.

IMAGING:
[**2157-4-7**] CARDIAC CATH
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
diffuse,
severe three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
severely
diseased and subtotally occluded. The LAD was occluded
proximally and
filled distally via the LIMA graft. There was a distal 80%
stenosis in
the native LAD. The LCx was occluded proximally. The large OM
fills via
the SVG graft, which also fills the LCx retrograde,
demonstrating a mid
vessel 70% lesion. The RCA was severely diseased with subtotal
occlusion
in the proximal to mid vessel. The distal RCA fills via the SVG
with a
moderate lesion in the small mid-PDA, distal to the graft
touchdown.
2. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated patent LIMA-LAD,
SVG-OM,
and SVG-RCA grafts, with severe disease in the native vessels as

described.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a low-normal systemic
arterial
blood pressure on vasopressors (SBP 118 mm Hg).
4. Successful PTCA of the distal LAD was performed using 2.0mm
and
2.25mm diameter balloons.  Final angiography showed normal flow,
no
apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, and SVG-RCA grafts.
3. PTCA of the distal LAD was performed.

[**2157-4-7**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the chest due to underlying
trauma board
and various radiopaque objects. Within this limitation no acute
intrathoracic
abnormality. A repeat PA and lateral chest radiograph is
recommended after
stabilization to establish the patient's baseline.
.
[**2157-4-7**] CT HEAD W/o CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular
territorial infarct.
2. Moderate ethmoidal sinus disease.
.
[**2157-4-7**] CTA CHEST
IMPRESSION:
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism. Evidence of
pulmonary
hypertension.
2. Moderate amount of right-sided effusion associated with
adjacent
atelectasis.
3. Pleural and pericardial calcified plaques could suggest prior
exposure to
asbestos.
4. Emphysematous changes in both lungs with scattered bullae.
5. Lung fibrosis, more prominent in the left lung.
6. Enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, measuring up to
10.6 mm.
.
[**2157-4-8**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis
is present. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is likely present
(could be heavy mitral annular calcification). There is mild LV
inflow gradient (6 mmHg). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Normally-functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis. Likely mitral
annuloplasty ring (vs. heavy mitral annular calcification) with
mild LV inflow obstruction. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**2157-4-8**] EKG
Slow atrial flutter versus atrial tachycardia. The Q-T interval
is prolonged.
There are Q waves in the anterior leads consistent with prior
infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
the rhythm

There is prominence of ill-defined pulmonary vessels, consistent
with vascular congestion secondary either to overhydration or
cardiac failure in a patient who has undergone a previous CABG
procedure. Nasogastric tube has been inserted and extends at
least to the upper stomach. Old healed rib fractures are again
seen.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2157-4-8**] 4:38 PM
IMPRESSION: No acute abnormality or evidence for herniation.
.
Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2157-4-9**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured a single pushbutton
activation,
likely a test, with no change in the very suppressed EEG or in
movement
by video. Early in the record there was a very fast activity
background
suggestive of medication effect. Beginning with the afternoon of
[**4-8**],
the background was of such low voltage that no clearly cortical
electrical activity was evident. This suggests an extemely
severe
encephalopathy, but it could be caused by medication or
temperature
change. The cardiac monitor suggested some form of conduction
block,
this would be assessed much better by routine cardiac tracings.
.
Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2157-4-10**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine
sampling and automated detection programs showed a very low
voltage slow
background with occasional additional bursts of slowing and a
very
infrequent sharp features. There were no simple spike or sharp
and slow
wave complexes. There were no electrographic seizures. Overall,
the
recording indicates a severe encephalopathy. This can be due to
medications, anoxia, or hypothermia. Other causes are possible,
but
less common. There was no seizure activity.
.
Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2157-4-11**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
However, it did capture a relatively long period of high voltage
fast
activity with sharp morphologies over the left side. During at
least
some of this period, the patient's head was being rubbed,
suggesting
that this activity was artifactual in nature, although at other
times
the patient was not being manipulated and the possibility of
underlying
epileptic activity given the sharp morphologies could not be
ruled out.
The background activity was slow and of low voltage throughout
the
recording, suggesting a severe encephalopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 85 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2143**]
(SVG-LCx, LIMA-LAD), redo in [**2152**] (SVG>PDA) with AVR,
constrictive pericarditis, type 1 DM who presented from home
after PEA arrest.

The patient was reportedly in PEA arrest initially with
conversion to VT after CPR. He was intubated in the ED and
started on amiodarone gtt. There was no evidence for
hypovolemia/bleeding, hyper/hypokalemia (K on arrival to ED was
4.0), medication overdoses, or trauma. The patient was taken
emergently to cath lab and found to have distal LAD lesion
treated with POBA. CT head was negative for intracranial
hemorrhage. Cooling protocol with Arctic Sun was initally
induced.  Neurology was consulted and the patient underwent
continuous EEG monitoring.  EEG was concerning for severe
encephalopathy and exam concerning for anoxic injury; the
patient was warmed to allow for proper EEG/Neurologic testing.
The patient's repeated neurologic exam and EEG findings
continued to be consistent with anoxic encephalopathy.  After
dicussion with family, the patient was made CMO to best reflect
his personal wishes.  He was extubated on [**4-10**] and a morphine
drip was initiated for comfort care.  The patient expired
shortly thereafter.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**] is a 73yoF with h/o bipolar d/o on Lithium who is
transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest. Patient is currently
unable to provide history, therefore details of HPI are obtained
from family and OSH records.  Per pt's family, pt had c/o
flu-like sx a week ago, with URI sx and cough.  Had also had
progressive DOE for past few weeks, to the point that she became
dyspneic when walking from her apartment to parking lot (~100
feet).  No h/o cardiac disease, however recently had stress test
which was reportedly negative and was scheduled to see
cardiologist this week.  Today the elevator in her apartment
building was broken, and when walking up 2 flights of stairs to
her apartment she became extremely SOB and called for help.  EMS
was called, started CPAP but she did not tolerate it, became
agitated, then became bradycardic and suffered asystolic arrest.
 CPR was started and she receieved epi 1mg x3 and lidocaine 100
in field then was taken to OSH.  At OSH ED received atropine x2
and additional epi x4.  Total time to ROSC estimated 25 minutes.
 She received chilled saline at OSH and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**], with T 33.9 en route.

In the ED, initial VS were T 33F, HR 85, BP 90/40 on dopa 20mcg
and epi 12.5mcg. GCS 3, not responding to commands but
withdrawing to painful stimuli.  Labs were notable for pH 6.94,
pCO2 64, HCO3 15, lactate 9.9. EKG showed sinus rhythm with LAD
and RBBB, low voltage.  (Of note initial ECG at OSH had anterior
STE, but resolved.)  Bedside TTE showed no RV enlargement,
global hypokinesis with depressed LVEF, c/w post-arrest. No
significant valvular disease. FAST exam negative. CTA showed no
PE but large bibasilar consolidations c/w aspiration pna.
Post-arrest consult team was consulted for initiation of arctic
sun cooling protocol. Epi gtt was increased to max, and she was
started on neo gtt. She received IV vancomycin 1g x1, IV
cefepime 2g x1, and IV levofloxacin 500mg x1.  She was admitted
to MICU for arctic sun cooling protocol.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she is intubated and sedated.  Vitals T
32.2F, HR 103, BP 97/70, O2 sat 94% on 100% FIO2.

Past Medical History:
-Bipolar disorder
-Severe asthma requiring hospitalizations years ago, no
exacerbations for many years (not currently treated)

Social History:
Per family, pt lives in [**Hospital3 4634**] but is very independent
with ADLs.  Occ smoking (1 pack per month), no EtOH or drug use.


Family History:
Notable for CAD in patient's parents and siblings, but no known

IMAGING:

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2116-10-19**]
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or
recent infarction. The ventricles and sulci are age appropriate
in
appearance. Areas of periventricular and subcortical white
matter hypodensity likely reflect sequela of chronic small
vessel ischemic disease. No concerning osseous lesion or
fracture is identified. There are air-fluid levels within the
nasopharynx and mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air
cells, compatible with intubation. The mastoid air cells are
grossly clear.  There is minimal mucosal thickening of the right
maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.

CTA CHEST [**2116-10-19**]
FINDINGS: There are massive bilateral dependent consolidations.

Additionally, within the aerated portions of the lungs, there
are bilateral ground-glass opacities extending from the hila.
Additional nodular opacities are likely related to acute
process, though no prior exams are available for comparison.

A small amount of free air is noted along the left base. While
this is not
clearly localized, there is suggestion on coronal images
(601B:24-26) that the collection is above the diaphragm and
within the pleural space.

The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified and no filling
defect to suggest pulmonary embolism is seen. No evidence of
acute aortic syndrome is identified. There are coronary artery
calcifications. No pericardial
effusion is seen.

The patient is intubated with the endotracheal tube tip low
lying at the level of the carina. Additionally, the balloon of
the endotracheal tube appears hyperinflated.  There is a
left-sided subclavian central venous catheter with tip reaching
the SVC.

An esophageal catheter is in place, incompletely imaged;
however, coursing to the stomach at least.

No lymphadenopathy is identified.

The left thyroid lobe is enlarged. Limited views of the upper
abdomen
demonstrate at least two calcified splenic artery aneurysms.

Bone windows demonstrate a nondisplaced sternal fracture
(602B:34), which may be related to chest compressions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Massive bilateral dependent consolidations, compatible with
aspiration.  Ground-glass opacities consistent with pulmonary
edema.
2. Air collection at the left base felt more likely above the
diaphragm
representing small pneumothorax vs bulla as opposed to contained
within the peritoneum. In comparison with prior radiographs of
the chest, it appears this was present prior to placement of
central line.
3. Low-lying endotracheal tube with tip at the level of the
carina and
hyperinflation of the endotracheal tube balloon.
4. Enlargement of the left thyroid lobe.
5. Non-displaced sternal fracture may be related to chest
compressions.

TTE [**2116-10-20**]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with distal septal hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 45%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free
wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with mild systolic
dysfunction. Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
73yo F with history of bipolar d/o transferred from OSH s/p
asystolic cardiac arrest, likely secondary to respiratory
etiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**] presented after witnessed episode of respiratory
distress of unclear etiology which progressed to asystolic
cardiac arrest.  Per EMS records, CPR was started in field and
ROSC occured after 25 minutes of pulselessness.  Post-cardiac
arrest hypothermia protocol was initiated at OSH and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued management.  On arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**] she was intubated, cooled to 33 degrees F and was
requiring maximum dose of 3 pressors (neo, levo, VPA) to
maintain blood pressure.  She became progressively hypoxic and
acidotic on CMV ventilation despite max vent support with 100%
FIO2 and PEEP 24.  Rewarming was started at 1600 on [**10-20**].  She
had continuous EEG monitoring per hypothermia protocol which
showed evidence of seizure activity, and she was loaded with IV
keppra. On [**10-21**] she became bradycardic and was noted to be
pulseless.  A code blue was called for pulseless arrest and CPR
was initiated.  Rhythm showed asystole, received epi 1mg x3, 1
amp NaHCO3.  Attending physician met with patient's family, who
decided to terminate resuscitation.  Time of death was declared
at 1:39AM.  [**Location (un) 511**] Organ Bank notified, declined patient as
donor.  Medical examiner was notified and declined autopsy.

EEG ([**2120-2-14**]):
This is an abnormal EEG due to the frequent electrographic
seizures. The seizures began in a generalized fashion and
evolved over
thirty seconds to become higher amplitude and slower with an
abrupt
cessation. Per the technician's notes, the seizures were
associated
with upward eye deviation. Between seizures, a suppressed and
disorganized background was seen, with occasional bursts of
generalized
slow transients. These findings suggest a severe encephalopathy,
which
may be seen with ischemia, medication effect, toxic metabolic
abnormalities or infections.
.
EEG ([**2120-2-16**]):
This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no clinical or
electrographic seizures. Background rhythms were decreased in
the delta
frequency range predominantly. In addition, there were some
generalized
bursts of delta slowing followed by low voltage suppressive
periods, as
well. No evidence for electrographic seizures was seen in this
day's
recording.
.
EEG ([**2120-2-21**]):
This is an abnormal EEG due to the suppressed background
rhythm, bursts of generalized slowing and generalized frequent
sharp and
slow wave discharges. This burst suppression pattern suggests a
severe
encephalopathy, which may be due to medication effect or
ischemic/hypoxic injury. No electrographic seizures were noted.
.
MRI ([**2120-2-17**]):
No evidence of acute infarct or enhancing lesions are
identified. Small area of increased signal in the medial right
occipital lobe could be due
to chronic infarct or due to an incidental slow flow in a small
venous structure along the surface of the brain.  Mild changes
of small vessel
disease.
.
Head CT ([**2120-2-14**]):
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
CT angio chest ([**2120-2-14**]):
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
Pulmonary venous congestion, as well as trace ascites about the
liver and small pleural effusions. Borderline aneurysmal
dilatation of the aortic root, and ectatic origin of the
innominate artery. Subcentimeter hypodense focus in the liver,
too small to characterize.  Acute right-sided rib fractures.
Suspicious spiculated nodule in the right upper lobe, raising
strong concern for a primary lung cancer.


Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission, the patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and
were found to be mildly elevated.  This, in conjunction with no
obvious signs of ischemia on his ECG, suggested that the
patient's primary event was somewhat unlikely be an ischemic
event.  He was maintained on telemetry and had no evidence of
arrhythmias.
.
Due to his persistent unresponsiveness and the patient's history
of requiring defibrillation and possibly having stopped
breathing, the neurology team was consulted to assess for anoxic
brain injury.  Due to concern for seizures (as suggested by his
down-beating nsytagmus), neurology recommended an EEG which was
performed on hospital day #1 and found him to be in status
epilepticus.  He was loaded with IV phenytoin and kept on a
maintenance dosing with therapeutic levels.  A subsequent
24-hour EEG over the next 2 days showed that he was no longer in
status epilepticus, though he remained completely unresponsive.
An MRI was performed and showed no obvious infarcts though, per
neurology, this did not at all rule out anoxic brain injury.
Another EEG was performed and showed a burst suppression pattern
which, per neurology, was suggesstive of a severe encephalopathy
and could be consistent with anoxic brain injury.  He was
monitored for several more days (due to the concern that he may
have been in a prolonged post-ictal state) with still no change
in his neurologic status.  A family meeting with the neurology
team was held on [**2-23**] during which the neurology team explained
the extremely low likelihood of the patient having any
meaningful neurologic recovery.  The family and primary team
then met with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the palliative care service on [**2-24**]
during which the family decided to pursue comfort measures only
(using the patient's living will as guidance).  On [**2-25**], per the
family's wishes and the patient's living will, the patient was
extubated while receiving medications for comfort.  He expired
shortly thereafter.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 54 F with h/o non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, diastolic CHF
with EF >55%, MR, severe pulm HTN thought [**2-21**] UIP/IPF on
steroids, DM2, HTN, PAF on coumadin, s/p renal Xplant in [**2143**] on
IS, who presents from [**Hospital 21970**] Hospital after asystolic arrest.
Per report, the patient presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital on
[**2149-8-2**] after feeling sudden onset of palpitations, chest pain,
and SOB. In the ED, she was treated for her CP but was found to
be in pulm edema and rapid afib. She was admitted to the ICU for
further care, where they aggressively rate controlled her and
diuresed her with lasix. Given her rapid afib, the patient was
started on sotalol on [**8-4**], where she converted to sinus rythm
on [**8-5**]. The patient remained stable until the afternoon of
transfer.

Per report, the patient subsequently went into asystolic arrest
at about 2:30PM on [**8-10**] requiring defibrillation, epi 1mg x4,
atropine 1mg x1, vasopressin 40units x1, lidocaine 100mg x1,
Amiodarone 150mg x1, bicarb, Ca returning her to sinus rythm.
There were no reported shocks. She was intubated during this
event and started on dopamine/neo for sbps in the 80s. In the
ICU, a PA line was placed demonstrating CVP 16, PAP 85/35 and
PCWP 40 with CO 1.4. A R fem A-line was placed, as was a temp
pacing wire for bradycardia. The patient was then switched to
nitro/levophed and given lasix 100mg IV x1. Bedside echo showed
EF 40%. ABG at the time of transfer was 7.35/31/60 on 100% Fi02
and PEEP 5. Due to family request, the patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was intubated and sedated with
possible responsiveness. She arrived on nitro/levophed drip. She
was unable to provide history.

Also of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2149-6-12**] for increased abd girth and SOB thought [**2-21**] CHF
exacerbation. She was diuresed at that time with
lasix/metolazone. The patient also underwent R heart cath
confirming pulm hypertension(RVEDP = 20 mm Hg, mean PCWP 11 mm
Hg, pulmonary artery pressure 79/59 mm Hg). She underwent lung
biospy and evaluation by pulmonology showing likely UIP/IPF and
was started on high dose prednisone. She was also maintained on
cytoxan for her renal transplant.

ROS: Unable to obtain review of systems due to patient being
intubated/sedated.

[**2149-8-10**] CXR: Swan-Ganz catheter remains distally positioned with
the tip projecting lateral to the right hilum, likely within a
segmental branch of the right middle or right lower lobe artery.
Other devices remain in standard position except for a right
PICC line, which crosses the midline to terminate at the
junction of the left brachiocephalic and left subclavian veins.
Bilateral combined alveolar and interstitial opacities are again
demonstrated. Alveolar opacities improved on the left but worse
on the right, likely due to rapidly shifting edema, although
superimposed secondary process in the right lung such as
hemorrhage or aspiration is also possible in the appropriate
setting. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged, but
small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has increased.

Position of the PICC line and Swan-Ganz catheter have been
communicated by telephone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20858**] by telephone on [**2149-8-10**]

[**2149-8-10**] CXR: Swan-Ganz catheter projects distal to the right
hilar contour, likely within a proximal segmental vessel of the
right middle or lower lobe. Right PICC line courses medially
within the left brachiocephalic vein with distal tip at the
junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and left subclavian
vein.
Endotracheal tube tip is not well demonstrated, but has been
better visualized on the subsequent radiograph performed 2215
(dictated under clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) 21971**]). Temporary pacing lead terminates
in right ventricle and nasogastric tube courses below the
diaphragm to terminate in the distal stomach near the junction
with the duodenum.

Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and pulmonary vascularity is
engorged. Bilateral combined alveolar and interstitial pattern,
worse on the left than the right probably reflects pulmonary
edema. Small pleural effusions are present as well as
preexisting right-sided pleural thickening.

Position of lines and tubes was discussed by telephone on the
morning of [**2149-8-11**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21972**].

[**2149-8-10**] ECG:Probable sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia and
extensive baseline artifact. Low voltage in the limb leads. ST-T
wave changes anterolaterally consistent with ischemia. Compared
with the prior tracing of [**2149-6-19**] anterolateral ST-T wave
changes are more prominent and QTc interval is shorter.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 F with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, PAF, severe pulm HTN and
R heart failure, DM2, HTN, s/p renal xplant in [**2143**] presents
from OSH after episode of CP/SOB and cardiac arrest on day of
transfer to [**Hospital1 **].  She was coded with CPR, multiple doses of
epinephrine, atropine, CaCl, vasporession, bicarb, and dopamine
at the outside hopsital. Pressor support with levophed and nitro
on transfer.

Approximately one hour after arrival to the CCU at [**Hospital1 18**], the
patient went into PEA cardiac arrest.  She recieved CPR, epi,
atropine, CaCl, vasopressin, and bicarb.  Neosynephrine and
levophed were continued for pressor support.  Patient had
episodes of maintaining blood pressure after epinephrine but
then would become hypotensive and return to PEA when placed on
ventilator.  Patient developed pink, frothy sputum from ET tube.
 IV lasix 300mg and bumex x2 failed to create urine output.
Swan showed significantly evelvated PA pressures, at times
higher than SBP. Beside echo with no evidence for tamponade.
CXR without sign of pneumothorax.  Patient was not
hypo/hyperthermic.  Labs drawn during the code without evidence
of hypo/hyperkalemia.  Patient developed one episode of VFib and
was shocked and one episode of atrial fibrillation and she was
cardioverted.  Both attempts failed to produce profusing rhythm.
 Trial of inhaled NO to get pulm A pressures down failed
secondary to systolic hypotension.  Trial of hemodialysis failed
with systolic hypotension.  The code was called after 2 hours
and 15mins.  Patient's family was at the hospital and notified.
Priest called at the request of the family.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cardiac arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year old man
who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit status
post cardiac arrest.  History was obtained per the Emergency
Department report as well as from the patient's family.
Information was very limited regarding the circumstances of
his cardiac arrest.  Reportedly, the patient was at a local
restaurant where he was noted to be unresponsive.  EMS was
called and reported to arrive on scene within three minutes.
The patient was asystolic but regained a perfusing rhythm
after 2 mg of Epinephrine and 2 mg of Atropine.  He was
intubated in the field and brought to the Emergency
Department.  He remained unresponsive despite the
administration of Narcan.  CT examinations of the head,
chest, abdomen and pelvis were all unremarkable. Initial
chest x-ray showed a left retrocardiac opacity and prominent
interstitium though his lung volumes were low.  Subsequent
chest x-ray showed right main stem intubation with left lung
collapse which had corrected with withdrawal of the
endotracheal tube.

The patient was then transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for induced hypothermia given his
hemodynamic stability, ongoing unresponsiveness and recent
out of hospital cardiac arrest.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1) Hypertension.

2) Chronic low back pain, s/p lumbar discectomy x 2.

3) Cirrhosis.

4) h/o stab wound complicated by pneumothorax.

5) h/o lower extremity cellulitis.

6) s/p cholecystectomy.

7) Peripheral neuropathy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  According to his pharmacy, he was
on:
1. OxyContin 40 mg p.o. q12hours.
2. Percocet.
3. Nortriptyline.
4. Neurontin 1800 mg four times a day


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is divorced.  His son is a
policeman working in [**Name (NI) 8545**].  He drinks greater than one
case of beer per day.  He has a history of abuse of Percocet
according to his brother.  [**Name (NI) **] is currently homeless.  He was
recently arrested for altering a prescription according to
his pharmacy.  He had recently filled a prescription for 560
tablets of Percocet as well as 60 tablets of OxyContin early
last month.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for any history of sudden death or
coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 96.2,
blood pressure 150/80, heart rate 92, respiratory rate 16.
In general, he was unarousible, intubated, not on any
sedation.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - His pupils
were equal and three millimeters.  They were minimally
reactive.  His sclerae were anicteric.  The cardiac
examination was unremarkable without murmurs.  The lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen had normal
bowel sounds, soft and nontender.  Extremities had multiple
bilateral lower extremity excoriations.  Neurologic
examination - he was unarousible and without sedation.  He had no
spontaneous movements.  Flaccid.  Extremities - Babinski
reflex was equivocal bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission, laboratories were
remarkable for a partial thromboplastin time of 31.7, INR
1.4, potassium 3.2, glucose 182, lactate was initially 6.6.
Urine toxicology screen was negative.  Serum toxicology
screen was positive for TCAs.  Tylenol level was 15.  Alcohol
level was 199.  Initial blood gas was 7.31/46/500/77.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiac arrest - His arrest was of unknown
etiology at the time of admission.  No further history was
ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his
hospitalization.  CT angiogram had been negative for
pulmonary embolism.  The patient had an echocardiogram on
[**2164-4-27**], which showed a normal ejection fraction and
trivial mitral regurgitation; otherwise no obvious
abnormalities were seen.

Given the patient had an out of hospital arrest, remained
unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability, he was treated
with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling
blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body
temperature to 32 degrees Celsius for a period of twelve
hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent
six hours.  This was done, however, as in problem number two
below, we were not successful in any neurologic recovery.

Neurology - The patient remained unresponsive after the
induced hypothermia, the patient was noticed to develop
myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids.
Electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing
persistent seizure activity.  Neurology was consulted and the
patient was treated very aggressively, loaded with multiple
drugs, including Ativan and Propofol drips.  The patient
continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this.  He was
loaded with Dilantin and ultimately was treated with a Pentobarb
coma.  After multiple attempts of weaning the Pentobarb, the
patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was
never able to be suppressed.

Infectious disease - Over the course of his hospital stay,
the patient's white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17.
Multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately
found to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection.  For all
these infections, the patient was treated with Vancomycin and
he was also on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed
aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission.  Blood
cultures cleared by [**2164-5-4**].  Sputum culture as late as
[**2164-5-11**], however was still positive for coagulase positive
Staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.

The patient remained gravely ill throughout his
hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his
family with his son being his next of [**Doctor First Name **].  Ultimately it was
decided that the patient's wishes would be to not be
maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis
ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures
only.  With these goals of care, the patient expired on
[**2164-5-12**].  The family did consent to a postmortem
examination.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Cardiac arrest.

Anoxic brain injury

Status epilepticus

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.

MRSA urinary tract infection.

MRSA Bacteremia.

acute onset of shortness of breath prompting daughter to call
911. She was intubated in the field and arrived in the ED
without any palpable pulse and was found to be in ventricular
fibrillation. She was shocked and reverted into sinus rhythm.
She also received 2g of Magnesium while in the ED for concern
for torsades. Given a pH of 6.93 and lactate of 11 on arrival ED
staff communicated patient??????s poor prognosis to patient??????s
daughter who expressed not wanting escalation of care,including
invasive lines or IV pressors. The patient was admitted to the

Brief Hospital Course:
The hospital course for this 58 y/o M with sudden onset resp
failure and PEA arrest is as follows:
.
# Hemodynamic instability: Patient arrived on the floor
hemodynamically unstable with BP 60/40 while on dopamine gtt. He
was started on levophed and vasopressin gtt as well, but
remained hypotensive despite being on maximum pressors. His
heart rate was between 80-140's with frequent PVCs. Echo
revealed no tamponade, RV or LV dilatation. The decision was
made with the pts sister to continue medical care, but CPR was
felt to be not indicated.
.
# Resp Failure: Pt was intubated at the scene and was intially
oxygenating well; however, over the course of the hosp day, his
sats fell to the 70's despite being on AC 100% FiO2 and 10 PEEP.
He was found on CXR to have severe pulm edema felt to be [**1-13**]
aggressive fluid rescusitation.
.
# Septic Shock/Acidosis: Source remains unclear, but may be GI
in origin. Patient reeived 12 amps of Bicarb to help correct his
acidosis and was started on Vanc/Levo/Flagyl empirically. He was
also given stress dose steroids.
.
# Distended Abd: Pt was noted to have a distended abd on arrival
and there was concern for perforated bowel. Surgery was
consulted and felt that there was no acute GI process to warrant
surgical intervention. It was felt that the guaiac positive
stool could be a component of ischemic bowel compounded by DIC.
.
.
At 4:50PM on [**2164-1-24**], patient was pronounced dead of cardiac
arrest and resp failure. The discussion was made with family,
who felt that they would like an autopsy. The proper
arrangements were made.

Reason: ? PE
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old man s/p CABGx1(SVG-PDA)/aoroto-inominate
bypass,endovascular stents of the aortic arch and descending
aorta, today - VT arrest in NH
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 84-year-old man status post CABG x1 with
aortoinnominate bypass endovascular stent of aortic arch and
descending aorta. Today with V-tach arrest. Evaluate for
pulmonary embolism.

COMPARISON: [**2177-8-14**] CTA chest.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images of the chest were obtained
without and with IV contrast per non-gated chest pain protocol.
Multiplanar reformations were obtained.

CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There has been interval
decrease in size of the large right-sided pleural effusion,
which now is moderate in size. Diffuse bilateral ground-glass
opacities are seen throughout the lungs, likely representing
pulmonary edema. There has been interval development of opacity
within the left lower lobe, which could represent aspiration
pneumonia or atelectasis. The heart is enlarged. A saccular
aneurysm is again noted along the aortic arch. An aortic stent
is seen along the aortic arch. There is lack of IV contrast
within the aorta secondary to bolus timing. There are extensive
coronary and aortic calcifications. The patient is status post
median sternotomy.

CTA CHEST:

There is no evidence of filling defects within the pulmonary
arterial vasculature. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. As
mentioned above, the aorta is unopacified secondary to bolus
timing. A stent is seen extending along the aortic arch.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Diffuse bilateral opacities similar to prior study likely
represent pulmonary edema.
3. Interval improvement of right-sided pleural effusion, now
moderate in size.
4. Interval worsening of left lower lobe consolidation,
representing either pneumonia, aspiration or atelectasis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the CSRU. Due to unstable
hemodynamics and ventricular dysrhythmias, he was maintained on
Dopamine and Lidocaine drips. He urgently underwent chest CTA to
rule out pulmonary embolus and a head CT to rule out stroke. The
head CT found no evidence of infarction or hemorrhage, and he
ruled out for PE by CT angiogram. The CTA was however notable
for interval worsening of a left lower lobe consolidation,
representing either pneumonia, aspiration or atelectasis. Given
his VF arrest and likely oxygen deprivation, he continued to
experienced generalized myoclonus. The neurology service was
consulted for further evaluation and EEG was performed.  The EEG
showed generalized discharges and very little, if any normal
background was seen. Given his anoxic brain injury and grim
prognosis, the family decided to withdraw support. Patient
expired on [**9-1**] @[**2187**] with the family at bedside. Family
declined autopsy.

Chief Complaint:
s/p PEA cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Right subclavian line placement
Femoral line placement
Therapeutic hypothermia protocol
Needle decompression for pneumothorax
Bilateral chest tube placement

History of Present Illness:
70 y/o with DM2, HTN, HLD, asthma, who presented from her [**Hospital1 1501**]
with cardiac arrest.  She was reported to be in respiratory
distress, and when receiving a nebulizer, went into PEA arrest.
EMS was called, CPR was initiated and epinephrine was given x2.
The pt was intubated in the field and an I/O line was placed.
She arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] with CPR in progress, however shortly upon
arrival had confirmed return of spontaneous circulation with SBP
was low ~60s.  She was started on norepinephrine and
phenylephrine and dopamine were added sequentially.  Initial
labratory tests showed a lactate of 10 and a venous pH of 6.95.
She received one ampule of sodium bicarb and 3L NS.  Bedside
cardiac ultrasound showed global hypokinesis, but no pericardial
effusion or right heart strain.  ECG showed sinus rhythm.  ET
tube placement was confirmed by laryngoscopy (was pulled back
out of right main stem bronchus).  She had a sterile right
subclavian line placed and an unsterile femoral arterial line
placed.  She was started on the artic sun cooling protocol.
.
She then became increasingly more difficult to ventilate, with
high peak pressures.  Manual bagging was attempted, but was also
difficult.  Needle decompression was then preformed on the right
with positive release of air.  Right chest tube then placed,
however, bagging was persistently difficult.  Needle
decompression on left was negative, but chest tube was placed on
the left anyway, with improvement in bagging.
.
Family is here and attending spoke with family.  Requested
aggressive care including pressor support, but no CPR/DNR.
.
Most recent set of vitals prior to transfer: afebrile, 110,
87/56 18 100% on AC 300/24/8/100% with peak pressures 31.  Plan
was to get CT-A on way up to MICU to r/o PE.

ORGANISMS/ML..

TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function.

CTA Chest:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2. Bilateral chest tubes terminating in the medial lung bases.
No large pneumothorax.
3. Nonspecific patchy opacity in the right upper lobe, could
represent pulmonary contusion from chest compression and/or
insertion of chest tube, pneumonia or aspiration.

CT Head: Limited study. No acute intracranial pathologic
process. No intracranial hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
70F with DM2, HTN, HLD, and asthma, who presented from her [**Hospital1 1501**]
s/p PEA arrest.  Suspected that acute hypoxia, possibly
secondary to asthma exacerbation, had led to cardiac arrest.
The patient was intubated in the field, arrived to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
with CPR in progress, and shortly upon arrival was found to have
return of spontaneous circulation with SBP in the 60s.
Admission labs notable for lactate 10 and venous pH of 6.95.
She had a sterile right subclavian line placed and an unsterile
femoral arterial line placed.   She was bolused 3L NS, treated
with sodium bicarb, and started on norepinephrine,
phenylephrine, and dopamine for blood pressure support.  She was
started on the therapeutic hypothermic cooling protocol.  In
setting of patient becoming difficult to ventilate with high
peak pressures, she had right-sided needle compression with
positive release of air; right chest tube then placed.  Needle
decompression on left was negative for release of air; left
chest tube also placed.   Bedside cardiac ultrasound showed
global hypokinesis, but no pericardial effusion or right heart
strain.  ECG showed sinus rhythm.  CTA chest did not show e/o PE
or acute aortic pathology.  CT head was negative for acute
intracranial pathologic process and intracranial hemorrhage.
Per discussion between attending and patient's family, decision
was made to pursue aggressive care including pressor support,
but no CPR/DNR.  Patient was admitted to the MICU for further
management.  In the ICU, she continued to require maximum doses
of three pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure in the
setting of post-arrest distributive and cardiogenic shock.   She
was continued on the cooling protocol, and bedside EEG was
set-up.  Over the course of the day, she was noted to have an
increasing amount of ectopy on telemetry.  Another family
meeting was held between the ICU attending and the patient's
sister/HCP.  [**Name (NI) 227**] poor prognosis, decision was made to withdraw
aggressive care and focus on patient's comfort.  The patient
expired at 21:20 on [**2183-11-14**] with her family at the bedside.  The
family declined an autopsy.

History of Present Illness:
Patient's name per driver license is [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] of [**Doctor First Name 92582**],
[**State 108**]. Phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92583**]. Next of [**Doctor First Name **] is [**Name (NI) 7279**]
[**Name (NI) **] (wife). Phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92583**].
64M history of Prinzmetal's angina transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
to [**Hospital1 18**] s/p cardiac arrest. He has a history of recurrent chest
pain due to ""coronary artery spasm"" per wife with extensive
evaluation. He is very athletic.
While driving, the patient complained of acute onset of chest
pain. He took aspirin as usual. Approximately 20 minutes after
onset of chest pain, the patient had an acute alteration of
mental status. She pulled off the road and started CPR but could
not get a pulse.
EMS arrived and the patient was undergoing CPR. Total downtime
was approximately 7 minutes prior to arrival EMS. On arrival of
EMS the patient was in ventricular fibrillation. The patient was
intubated with 7.5 ETT placed at 22 and ACLS was initiated with
epinephrine and shocks for ventricullar fibrillation.
Pt was brought to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] during which he received 3 shocks
for fine ventricullar fibrillation. He was given lidocaine 100
mg x 2 and epinephrine 1 mg x 4. He transiently converted to
asystole and then back to V. fib. He also received 150 mg
amiodarone. He was also given magnesium and IV calcium. And
thereafter appeared to be hypotensive and bradycardic, and was
given atropine. Because of persistent hypotension and
bradycardia, a dopamine drip was initiated. Patient was packed
with ice and transported via med flight.
Per Med Flight documentation, patient received dopamin @ 15
mcg/kg/min, fentanyl 100 mcg in 50 mcg doses, amiodarone 1
mg/min. Vent settings were SIMV/PS 400x18 PEEP 7 PS 10 cm FiO2
100 %.
The patient was noted to have pulmonary edema on chest x-ray on
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. ECG prior to transport showed an idioventricular
rhythm with wide complex rhythm.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, initial VS were HR 92 102/85 RR 19 pOx 97 on
100%, 500x18, volume-control. His initial rhythm on arrival was
narrow complex.
An arterial line was placed in left groin. Central line was
placed in the left groin as well. Per ER reports, lines were
placed in sterile fashion although documentation was not sent
with ER paperwork. This has been requested.
CXR was performed showing diffuse bilateral opacities with air
bronchograms suggesting severe pulmonary edema, potentially
capillary permeability edema. Cardiac size was within normal
limits.
Labs were performed
CBC WBC 18 Hct 53 MCV 104 Plt 175 with differential N 81 B 7 L

CK 997 CK-MB 104 cTropnT 1.52
pH 7.09 pCO2 46 pO2 83 HCO3 15 Lactate 8.2 (from 10.4). After
ABG showed significant acidosis, RR was increased.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended admission to CCU for
post-arrest care. He was loaded plavix 600 mg PO x 1, aspirin
325 mg PO x 1, and started on heparin infusion.
The post-arrest consult service was consulted. Artic Sun cooling
protocol was initiated with goal temperature of 33 x 24 hours
(cooling start time: 15:10 on [**2151-4-4**]) and sedated to RASS -5.
He was given midazolam 2 mg/hr, fentanyl 50 mcg/hr, vecuronium
10 mg IV x 1 in addition to amiodarone 1 mg, dopamine 20 mg/kg.

Patient also became hypotensive (SBP 80-90s). His dopamine was
increased from 15 to 20, and he was started on levophed.
Admission Vitals: T 34.5 HR 86 BP 96/84 pOx 97 on 100%, 500x22,
volume-control.
.
Patient is not able to provide ROS given sedated.
.
In CCU, ECHO showed relatively preserved LVEF, no global wall
motion abnormalities, ? pericardial effusion, worse at apex.

Studies:
[**4-4**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The
recording showed a burst suppression pattern throughout. It did
not
change appreciably over the course of the record. There were no
electrographic seizures.

[**4-5**] EEG:
This telemetry captured one pushbutton activation. It
showed some muscle activity on EEG without signs of
electrographic
seizure. There was some chin movement seen clinically on video.
Overall, the patient remained in a burst suppression pattern
throughout
but, later in the record, there was some muscle artifact. There
were no
clear epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.

[**4-7**] EEG: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. The
background was of such low voltage that no activity or clearly
cortical
origin could be discerned. [Of note, this monitoring recording
was not
performed with technological investigations to determine the
presence or
absence of cortical activity.] The recording suggests an
extremely
severe encephalopathy. This assumes the absence of sedating
medication.

[**4-8**] EEG
Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the profound suppression
of the background rhythm such that no electrolytes or video
cortical origin was observed. There were some deflections
attributed to
movement artifact. It should be noted that this study was
performed as
a routine portable EEG without using technical specifications
for
obtaining an ""electrocerebral silence"" record. The very low
voltage
background without apparent reactivity indicates a very poor
prognosis
assuming that the lower voltages or not too sedating
medications,
hypotension, or hypothermia at the time.

[**4-4**] Echo:
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global
biventricular systolic function. Mildly dilated descending
thoracic aorta. No definite pathologic valvular flow identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
64M history of ? Prinzmetal's angina s/p witnessed VF arrest
with ROSC after defibrillation and ACLS who despite cooling
protocol and supportive therapy developed poor indicators of
perfusion (presenting lactate 10.4) and multi-organ failure with
hypotension requiring pressor support, acute respiratory
failure, acute renal failure, evolving shock liver, and impaired
neurological status after completion of rewarming and withdrawal
of sedation. Care was ultimately withdrawn per family, and the
patient passed away.

# s/p cardiac arrest
Patient s/p witnessed VF arrest in field. Prior cardiac work-up
negative in setting of chest pain episodes in past attributed to
coronary spasm. Etiology of current arrest was uncertain - may
be ischemic etiology vs. rhythm disturbance in setting of
coronary vasopasm. No evidence of STEMI.  The pt's echo did not
demonstrate any systolic dysfunction which would be expected if
there were a large MI.  Given downtime in field, pt had shock
with resultant multi-organ damage.  Pt was initiated on Arctic
sun cooling protocol.  Pt was placed on heparin infusion
initially for concern of thrombotic etiology of arrest, pt given
plavix and aspirin.  Pt required pressor support with dopamine
and norepinephrine.  The norepinephrine was able to be weaned
off.  The dopamine was withdrawn with the rest of his care at
the family's request when it was clear that there would be no
meaningful neurologically recovery.

# Neuroprotection s/p arrest:  Pt was initiated on Arctic Sun
cooling protocol s/p arrest.  After rewarming, neurology
conducted serial exams and EEGs. This revealed anoxic brain
injury post-cooling with incomplete brainstem reflexes and flat
EEG showing no identifable brain activity and no reactivity to
stimulation.  This occurred despite being fully off sedation.
These results were discussed with the family who subsequently
decided to withdraw care.

# Acute (uncompensated) primary respiratory acidosis, with
metabolic acidosis, with increased anion gap:
Patient had acute hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
as result of arrest, s/p intubation and mechanical ventilation.
Decreased perfusion also lead to anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Pt was aggressively fluid resuscitated and was given HCO3
boluses as needed to correct lactic acidosis.  Pt was
hyperventilated to correct respiratory acidosis. CVVH was
initiated.  Pt's ABGs and lactates improved with these measures.


# Pulmonary edema
Patient had pulmonary edema in setting of cardiac arrest, shock,
most likely a mixed picture of both cardiogenic and
non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Aggressive fluid resuscitation
worsened pulmonary edema.  The patient was started on CVVH to
remove fluid, which improved edema and decreased vent
requirements

# Acute renal failure:
Cr on admission 1.4 (eGFR 51) with unknown baseline. Patient
became anuric with worsening kidney function and fast rise in
potassium. Etiology likely pre-renal with ATN given prolonged
hypotension.  Pt's acute renal failure necessitated CVVH.  This
was used to normalize electrolytes, assist with pt's acid base
status, and remove fluid when the patient developed severe
pulmonary edema.

# Thrombocytopenia/Fingertip ischemia:
Most likely this occurred in setting of severe illness resulting
in suppression of platelet production.  Other etiologies include
low grade DIC in setting of mostly normal DIC labs, sepsis, and
HIT.  PF4 antibody was negative and 4T score was low, so HIT
unlikely. Coombs negative.  Argatroban was initiated but then
stopped.  Fingertip ischemia most likely from hypotension and
pressors.


# Leukocytosis/Low grade fever
WBC normalized, but pt did have elevated temperature which
required increased cooling.  No clear localizing source. Pt
started on vancomycin and zosyn.

# Transaminitis
Unknown baseline. Elevation likely in setting of shock liver
from poor perfusion

IMAGING:
CXR [**2169-6-22**]: Increased right lower lobe opacity, probably due to
pulmonary edema or infection. (Initially read as wedge-shaped
opacity).
TTE [**6-22**]: Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
- EF = 20-25%. Mild AR. Moderate-to-severe MR. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-5-2**], LV systolic function
has markedly deteriorated and severity of MR has increased.
inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis was present on the prior
study.
CXR [**2169-6-23**]: More extensive left lower lobe opacity, probably
due to atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Bilateral effusions and persistent right lower lobe process,
suggesting edema versus infection.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33905**] is a 72 yo M with history of CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on
HD who presented with VT/ PEA/ cardiac arrest with prolonged
resuscitation (CPR > 45min), intubated for airway protection,
whose course was complicated by anoxic brain injury. Hospital
course by problem:

1)Arrhythmia: The original rhythm (VT/ PEA/ cardiac arrest) was
unclear as EMS found pt down and shocked him right away. The
patient was treated with cardioversion, initially started on
lidocaine, then started on amiodarone to prevent further
episodes of VT. The patient briefly went into atrial
fibrillation (although he had no documented history of this in
the past), but remained in NSR throughout the remainder of his
hospital course, with only occasional APBs and PVCs on
telemetry. The etiology of original arrhythmia was most likely
scar-induced. Electrolyte abnormality was unlikely given stable
electrolytes at OSH. Ischemic etiology was unlikely given
cardiac enzymes not commensurate with that of MI.

2)Hemodynamics: Upon admission the pt was initially hypotensive.
BP was maintained with a levophed drip, which was slowly weaned
as tolerated. Follow-up echo on [**2169-6-22**] showed EF of 20-25% with
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which had
markedly deteriorated. Volume management was maintained via
hemodialysis.

3) CAD w/3 vessel disease:The patient was maintained on ASA and
statin given his history of CAD.

4)Poor oxygenation: CXR findings on [**6-22**] (above) were initally
read as concerning for PE. But because PE could not be ruled out
(as contrast could not be administered through the pt's IV site
and the patient??????s family did not want to place a central line
with a larger lumen for this purpose), patient was started on a
heparin drip.  The patient remained intubated for airway
protection throughout his hospital stay. Ventilator settings
were weaned as tolerated to FiO2 of 50%.  Subsequent CXR
findings (Above) showed evidence of a LLL infiltrate and +
sputum stain of GPC on [**6-22**], and the patient was empirically
treated for a PNA with vancomycin/levofloxacin/flagyl. On
hospital day 2 neurology recommended that levo/flagyl be
discontinued as these meds could decrease the seizure threshold
(see below), and ceftriaxone was started instead.

4) Anoxic brain injury: On hospital day 2, the patient was
observed to have twitching of his eyelids and chin. He was
placed on 24 hour EEG monitoring, and neurology determined him
to be in status epilepticus secondary to anoxic brain injury.
The patient was started on dilantin and phenobarbitol and was
placed on continuous EEG monitoring. After hospital day 3 there
were no observed recurrences of this seizure-like activity.
However, after performing serial neuro exams, the neurology team
felt that the patient??????s overall prognosis was grim for a
meaningful neurological recovery.

5) DM was controlled with an ISS.

6) FEN: On hospital day 2 tube feeds were started without
complication.

7) Prophylaxis: The patient received heparin gtt initially for
suspected PE, and was maintained on heparin drip for atrial
fibrillation. Pt also received a PPI, and bowel meds prn for
prophylaxis.

8)After much discussion with the primary team with input from
neurology, on [**2169-6-27**] the patient??????s daughter and health care
proxy decided to remove the ventilator and proceed with comfort
level of care.  Patient was extubated on [**2169-6-27**]. He passed away
at 12:27 pm.

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yof with history of HTN, DM, hypothyriodism, BIBEMS to OSH ED
s/p witnessed PEA at home.  Per report, she was in her usual
state of health till 2pm on [**2141-12-2**], after returning from
shopping all day.  Her husband fell onto her and caused her to
fell.  She banged her head against the wall on her way down.
Her granddaughter was present during this time and called 911.
Fire department arrived in 2 minutes, found patient to be
non-responsive without a pulse and apnec.  She received CPR via
BLS for 2 mins.  When ACLS arrived noted patient to be
unresponsive, in sinus brady, no shock was delivered.
.
Once arrived to OSH ED, she was given 80 of succ and 80 of
propofol for RSI (7.5, 24cm at lip, position confirmed - 1 cm
from carina).  Repeat rhythm was in NSR rate of 60-40.  Head CT
was wnl, noted for C3-C6 fusion.  Abd US noted to have calcified
aorta without dissection.  Patient was noted to be unresponsive
per report of OSH, and not moving her limbs.  Cooling was
initiated at 1645 for a baseline of 35 with a goal of 33, this
was done with 2L of cold NS.  Patient was given veccuronium,
versed, propafol.  EKG showed sinus, first degree AV block,
normal ST-T waves, LAD.  Labs were significant for WBC of 5.7,
H&H of 8.8 and 26.7.  Chem7 was Na 137, K 4.4, Cl 107, HC03 21,
BUN 31, cr 1.2, glu 154.  Trop of 0.01.  ABG of 7.38, pCO2 of
38, pO2 483, HCO3 23.  At this point, she was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further managment.
.
In our ED, her inital vitals were: brady 30-40 SR, BP 130-140,
sats 100% FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5.  Temp was noted to be 32.8C
with ice packs, and HR showed persistent bradycardia, cooling
was temporarily stopped, then restarted.  Echo was performed in
the ED by cardiology fellow: The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricle
appears slightly enlarged but is contracting well; [**Last Name (un) 13367**]
sign is absent. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.  Labs were similar to OSH.  pH of 7.45, PCO2 26, PO2

ECHO [**12-2**] There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 65%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

CXR [**12-2**] Single supine AP portable view of the chest was
obtained.
Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately the 3.3 cm
above the
level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the
level of the diaphragm, distal aspect not included on the image.
Right perihilar opacity may relate to atelectasis or
consolidation from aspiration, less likely infection. The left
lung is clear. No large pleural effusion is seen, although a
trace effusion may be difficult to exclude. The cardiac
silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and
tortuous.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F with history of HTN, DM, hypothyroidism presents s/p
cardiac arrest on cooling protocol, now deceased.

#PEA arrest - Patient was found to be pulseless after her
husband fell on top of her prior to admission.  She received CPR
in the field but no medications or shocks.  She was brought to
an OSH where she was intubated and received 2L of chilled NS for
post-arrest cooling protocol, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.  The precise etiology of her arrest is not
known, however it is not thought to be ischemic.  Here, she was
started on dopamine for hypotension and cooling protocol was
continued for 24 hours via Arctic Sun.  She was rewarmed and
sedation was weaned, her mental status began to slowly improve.
TTE after cooling showed a preserved EF with no wall motion
abnornalities.  There was briefly concern for PE on her repeat
TTE, but CTA chest did not show a PE.

#Neurologic status - She was reported to be not moving her
extremities in the field prior to arrival at the OSH, which is
why the cooling protocol was initiated after her arrest.  After
rewarming was complete, versed and fentanyl were weaned and her
mental status slowly improved, although she had movement in all
4 extremities.  Head CT did not show any acute changes.
Continuous EEG during and after cooling did not show evidence of
seizure.  Neurology was consulted and they felt that she would
have low likelihood of having improvement in her mental status
given her prolonged state of altered mental status due to severe
anoxic brain injury. The patient's family expressed their wish
to transition the patient to comfort measures only. The patient
was extubated [**12-7**] and continued to spontaneously breath until
her death on [**12-9**] at 11:33am.

#Potential aspiration and leukocytosis - There was initial
concern for aspiration with subsequent respiratory arrest after
her fall.  She subsequently developed a worsening opacification
on her CXR but, in alignment with her family's subsequent wishes
for comfort measures only, the patient was not started on abx.

#Pneumomediastinum - There was a small amount of air in the
mediastinum noted on CXR and CT chest.  Etiology is not entirely
clear, this may have been introduced during right IJ line
placement.  Thoracic surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] and felt that there
was no intervention required.

#Anemia - Her baseline hct is unknown, but she was found to be
anemic with a normal MCV and hct in the 26-29 range during this
admission.  Iron studies were normal.  B12 and folate were 1009
and 9.6.  There was no evidence of bleeding on exam.

#HTN - Home lisinopril was held because of her hypotension at
admission

#Hypothyroidism - Her home levothyroxine was initially converted
to the equivalent IV dose and was continued.

#Code status this admission: FULL CODE, transition to DNR/DNI,
transition to CMO.

was called by a friend who reported the patient became
unresponsive after heroin and alcohol use. Down time prior to
EMS arrival was approximately 10 minutes per report. He was
intubated in the field, and received 30 minutes of CPR with
initial rhythm of asystole followed by PEA. He received epi X2,
atropine X2, HCO3 X2 and narcan 6 mg.  Pt initially taken to
[**Hospital 8125**] Hospital where intial BP 58/22. Pt treated with IV fluid
bolus with improvement in his BP and 2amp of bicarb. Pupils were

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 30 yo male s/p cardiac arrest in the setting of
suspected heroin overdose. Reported downtime of ~10min in the
field f/b 30min of CPR before restoration of vital signs.
Admitted to the Medical ICU for Artic Sun post-arrest induced
mild hypothermia protocol.

#Anoxic brain injury - Minimal neurologic response prior to
initiation of cooling protocol. 24hr protocol completed and
rewarming initiated. During rewarming, he developed profound
rigors and subsequently became febrile to 104. The rigors were
not responsive to increasing sedation or demerol, thus he was
re-paralyzed. The following morning, the paralytic was
discontinued, and he developed movements more consistent with
seizure activity most prominent in the R arm and R leg.  He was
loaded with phenytoin with some improvement in seizure activity
and neurology was consulted. He developed persistent
breakthrough seizure-like movements requiring boluses of
phenytoin and initiation of Keppra.  A video EEG was performed
and results showed diffuse encephalopathic changes without
evidence of electrographic seizures. An MRI was performed on
[**2145-10-6**] which revealed findings c/w global infaraction,
anoxic brain injury, and diffuse cerebal edema. On the morning
of [**2145-10-7**], pt was noted to have a change in his pupillary exam
and papilledema. A STAT head CT revealed complete loss of
grey-white matter differentiation c/w diffuse cerebral edema. Pt
was started on mannitol infusion, HOB to 30 degrees, and
hyperventilated to a PCO2 of 28.  Neurosurgery was consulted,
placed a bolt, found the initial ICP to be 24. Pt was continued
on mannitol q6h, Keppra, and continous ICP monitoring (ICPs
ranged from 20s-60s). Neurologic exams off-sedation revealed
absent corneal reflexes, absent cold calorics, and no response
to painful stimuli. Apnea tests x 2 ([**10-11**], [**10-13**]) revealed that
patient continued to demonstrate respiratory effort, and thus
did not meet criteria for brain death. After ongoing discussions
with the family regarding his poor prognosis, and based on
previously expressed wishes of the patient, the family decided
to shift goals of care to CMO on the morning of [**2145-10-14**]. He was
extubated, made comfortable with morphine, and declared dead at
1:39pm on [**2145-10-14**]. NEOB had been contact[**Name (NI) **] and pt was ruled out
for donation after cardiac death.

# S/p Cardiopulmonary Arrest: Pt received the 24hr post-arrest
hypothermia protocol. Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were
negative for any significant ischemia. A transthoracic ECHO done
on [**2145-10-5**] revelead normal structure and function. Pt remained
hemodynamically stable without need for vasopressor support.

#Fever: Pt became febrile in the midst of diffuse rigors. Blood,
urine, and sputum cultures were sent. A CXR on [**2145-10-6**] revealed
a new LLL opacity, consistent with atelectasis vs. infiltrate.
He was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl to cover for possible
aspiration. He was switched to Ceftriaxone and Flagyl the
following morning (concern for lowering the seizure threshold on
flouroquinolones). Blood and urine cultures were negative but
sputum cultures were positive for Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and
Staph Aureus. Bronchoscopy on [**2145-10-20**] revealed copious purulent
secretions. Pt was treated with appropriate IV antibiotics until
the decision made made to focus on CMO.

The family was provided with support from social work and the
hospital priest & chaplaincy services. They were at the bedside
when he expired.

Mr. [**Known firstname 108323**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG, s/p
pacer insertion, AAA who presented to the ED after his wife
heard him fall in the bathroom.  EMS was activated by his wife
and on arrival he was found in to be in VT.  He was shocked
twice to PEA.  He was given 4mg Epi, 3mg Atropine total.  On
arrival to the ED, he was found to have a spontaneous pulse and
CPR was stopped.  He was intubated in the field.  Total out of
hospital CPR time was 30 minutes.
.
In the ED, initial BP was 130/62, HR 112.  The post-arrest team
and cardiology consult were called.  He was given Amiodarone
150mg bolus with a drip at 1mg/min.  His blood pressures dropped
to 77/54 and he was started on peripheral dopamine, maxed out at
20mcg/kg/min.  His blood pressure increased to 92/35, HR 59.  A
CXR was done showing the tube to be too deep and it was pulled
back 2cm.  After discussion with the family, they did not want
further heroic measures.  A central line was not placed and he
did not have a head CT.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, DM, CHF EF 35-40%,
afib, stage IV diabetic nephropathy (Cr 3.0) who presented to
the ED after a witness unresponsive episode. Per the family, he
was walking down the street and had a wittness loss of
consciousness. EMS was called and he was taken to [**Hospital 4199**]
hospital. On arrival (11:20am) he was in asystole. He was given
Epi X 3 and Atropine X 1. He then went into Vfib and shocked
(200 joules). He then went into Afib and became bradycardic.
Dopamine was started. He regained a perfusing rhythm at 11:35am.
He was given Calcium chloride, Magnesium, Amiodarone 300mg IV X
1 and bicarb during the resuscitation at [**Last Name (un) 4199**]. He later had
another episode of VT at 12:40 and an amiodarone gtt was
started. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
Per [**Hospital1 18**] ED report, he had presented to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital in
Vfib, then became asystolic. After the initial resuscitation he
had 2 additional asystolic arrests in the [**Last Name (un) 4199**] ER.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were T98.2 HR75, BP149/106, RR32
100% on the vent. The post-arrest consult team was called and
recommended cooling him to 33-34 degrees and weaning his
propofol to fentanyl/versed. A R femoral line was placed, he was
given 1L IVF and had a head, chest, abdomen CT done without
contrast. He was kept on dopamine, propofol and amiodarone. He
was given 1mg Atropine for bradycardia to 35During transfer to
the floor, he became bradycardic. External pacer pad were placed
and his dopamine was increased from 15mcg/kg to 20mcg/kg. He was
briefly externally paced and given additional an additional 1mg
of Atropine. On arrival to the CCU he was not being paced and
his dopamine was back down to 15mcg/min. CT scan showed a
sternal fracture and mediastinal hematoma.

STUDIES:
.
CXR ([**2117-1-16**]): Cardiomegaly with mild congestive heart failure.
Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube in standard positions.
.
CT spine ([**2117-1-16**]):
1. No acute fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
2. Pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion, partially imaged.

3. Multilevel degenerative changes, worst at C4-C5, which
predisposes the patient to cord injury. Consider MRI for further
evaluation if clinically indicated.
.
Non-contrast head CT ([**2117-1-16**]): NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no
intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation abnormality. The ventricles and extra-axial
spaces are appropriate for age. Intracranial carotid artery
atherosclerotic calcifications are moderate-to-severe. Mucosal
secretions within the nasal passages, nasopharynx, and
opacification of the ethmoid sinus air cells are noted, at least
partially related to recent intubation. There is mucosal
thickening in bilateral maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid
sinuses, mild in degree. Imaged mastoid air cells are clear.
There is no fracture. Mild prominence of the ventricles and
cerebral sulci is likely related to age-appropriate atrophy.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality. Sinus disease, as
noted above.
.
CT chest, abdomen, pelvis ([**2117-1-16**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly displaced transversefracture of the mid sternum likely
involves the medial aspect of the anterior left third rib with
associated substernal anterior mediastinal hematoma.
2. Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral small pleural effusions
with associated atelectasis.
3. 1.9 cm right renal hypodense lesion, likely a complex cyst. A
renal ultrasound is recommended further evaluation.
4. Gallbladder wall edema and trace perihepatic ascites, likely
related to heart failure.
.
ECHO [**2117-1-18**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls,
distal anterior wall and distal lateral wall. There is an apical
left ventricular aneurysm. The remaining walls contract well
(LVEF 30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be quantified (but pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension is suggested). There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel
CAD. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2116-1-6**], left ventricular function has further
deteriorated and the right ventricular cavity is more dilated
with new free wall hypokinesis.
Is there a history to suggest a primary pulmonary process (e.g.,
pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm, etc.


Brief Hospital Course:
79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who
presents s/p cardiac arrest.
.
# CARDIAC ARREST: There was little information about the events
of the hours that preceded his admission.  We know that he had a
witnessed syncopal episode; he may have been in asystole at an
OSH.  The etiology of the cardiac arrest was likely [**2-9**]
hyperkalemia.  He underwent Artic Sun cooling protocol at [**Hospital1 18**],
which was complicated by persistent bradycardia to the 20's.
Therefore, Arctic sun was terminated after 6 hours.  He was
placed on Epinephrine, Isoproteronol & Dopamine and his HR
eventually rebounded.  His pressors were slowly weaned.
Neurology was consulted regarding his neurological prognosis.
Based on his EEG result, non-arousal, and lack of brainstem
reflexes except for overbreathing on the ventilator, Neurology
suggested that meaningful recovery from the neurological
standpoint is very unlikely.  Serial family meetings were held,
and the family decided to withdraw care on [**2117-1-23**] at 10am.
Following extubation, patient expired 40 minutes later at
10:40am on [**2117-1-23**].
.
# ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Neurology was consulted on admission and
patient was placed on a 48 hour EEG per protocol. P er
examination, the patient demonstrated no brainstem function,
save for a respiratory rate that exceeded the ventilator
settings.  Over the next few days, he did demonstrate the
presence of a gag reflex as well as a questionable R-sided
pupillary constriction and corneal reflex, but despite being off
pressors and sedation, he did not exhibit further cortical
function.  EEG's demonstrated some e/o encephalopathy.  Serial
family meetings were held, and the family decided to withdraw
care on [**2117-1-23**] at 10am.  Following extubation, patient expired
40 minutes later at 10:40am on [**2117-1-23**].
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient was placed on a ventilator s/p
cardiac arrest. His chest CT demonstrated mild pulmonary edema.
Sputum culture from [**1-18**] and [**1-21**] grew out Moraxella for which
he was covered with ceftriaxone. He remained intubated with
stepwise decrements in his degree of pressure support.
Following extubation, patient expired 40 minutes later at
10:40am on [**2117-1-23**].
.
# ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Patient with known CKD, baseline Cr 3.0.
On admission, patient was anuric, likely due to ATN s/p shock
and poor perfusion despite receiving several liters of IVF's at
the OSH and in the ED.  His electrolytes and acid/base status
was stabilized after he was placed on CVVH.  His CVVH filter was
clotted off on [**1-18**].  Given that his his UOP improved and his
electrolytes were stable off CVVH, and because of his poor
prognosis, CVVH was discontinued.  His electrolytes were stable
during the rest of the hospitalization.
.
# CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40% in [**12-15**], down to
30-35% on repeat TTE on [**2117-1-18**], likely further impaired by the
cardiac arrest.  Patient with mild pulmonary edema on chest CT,
but intubated since admission.  His ACE was held given renal
insufficiency and his fluid status was managed as above.
.
# Leukocytosis: Patient presented with leukocytosis & grossly
positive U/A, but elevated WBC may also be due to stress
response to cardiac arrest.  He was started on Ceftriaxone 1g IV
q24H on [**1-17**].  Sputum cx was positive for Moraxella & blood
cultures demonstrated coag negative staph.  Vancomycin was added
on [**1-19**].
.
# DMII: Patient was continued on Lantus with regular insulin
sliding scale.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year old
male with a history of bilateral lung cancer, status post
resection and chemotherapy and radiation who experienced
shortness of breath and diaphoresis the morning of his
admission.  He called his family and they found him to be
short of breath, diaphoretic and they called Emergency
Medical Services.  The patient then had a PEA witnessed
arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated.  The
patient was intubated in the field.  He was given Epinephrine
via his endotracheal tube, Atropine and his pulse and blood
pressure were covered in the ambulance.  The patient was
taken to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.  At [**Hospital 882**] Hospital he again
arrested (PEA arrest), cardiopulmonary resuscitation was
initiated again and he was resuscitated with 2 mg of
Epinephrine, 1 mg of bicarbonate and his first arterial blood
gas was 6.90 pH, pCO2 of 111 and pAO2 of 123.  He was started
on a Dopamine drip.  A left subclavian central line was
placed and the patient was started on a Versed drip.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
further management as he received his care here.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Right upper lung cancer, right
upper lobe biopsy in [**2166-4-26**] consistent with
adenocarcinoma, status post wedge resection, left upper lobe
bronchial washings with poorly differentiated large cell
cancer, status post lobectomy.  The patient underwent
chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Taxol and radiation there
which he finished the week prior to his admission.  2.
Hypertension.  3.  Hypercholesterolemia.  4.  Peptic ulcer
disease.  5.  Chronic sinusitis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive tobacco use with a 50 pack year
history until [**2165**].  He had a history of occupational
exposure to asbestos.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for skin cancer, question melanoma,
grandfather with carcinoma of the lip.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q. day,
Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day, Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.
day, Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day, Colace and Percocet prn,
Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s., Tylenol, Flovent, Atrovent,
Nasocort, Levaquin 500 q. day times seven days, Compazine
prn, Metamucil, Robitussin, Oxycodone prn, Oxacillin prn.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed temperature 93.3, blood pressure 75/54, heartrate
129.  Ventilator settings, assist control 800 by 16 with a
rate of 16, 100% FIO2 and 5 positive end-expiratory pressure.
In general he was intubated and not responsive to painful
stimuli.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils dilated,
not responsive to light.  Neck, unable to assess jugulovenous
pressure.  Cardiovascular, tachycardiac, regular rate, no
murmurs.  Lungs, coarse breathsounds bilaterally anterior
with question of slightly diminished breathsounds at the left
base.  Abdomen, decreased bowel sounds, soft, nondistended.
Rectal deferred.  Obstetrics negative at outside hospital.
Extremities, cool, mottled, positive dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  No edema and no urine was noted in his Foley
catheter bag.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 4.3,
hematocrit 33.1, platelets 161, INR 1.4, PTT 38.5, ALT 314,
AST 325, ALV 922, alkaline phosphatase 133, amylase 148,
calcium 1.1, free calcium 1.17, lactate 6.9, sodium 142,
potassium 3.3, chloride 101, bicarbonate 20, BUN 23,
creatinine 1.1, anion gap of 20.  Phosphorus 7.8, albumin
3.0.  His electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with
right bundle branch block, T wave inversions in V1 and V2, T
wave inversion in V3.  Lower extremity ultrasound showed
bilateral common femoral deep vein thrombosis and left
superior clot.  Chest x-ray showed right upper lobe
infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary - The patient underwent a
computed tomographic angiography which showed multiple
pulmonary embolisms.  He underwent thrombectomy with directed
total parenteral alimentation.  An inferior vena cava filter
was placed by Interventional Radiology.  He was started on
heparin.  He experienced hypoxemia and ventilatory failure
secondary to pulmonary embolism but he also has a history of
underlying lung disease including wedge resections,
radiation, likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

During his hospital course the patient was treated for his
pulmonary emboli and he was able to be slowly weaned from the
ventilator.  On [**2166-12-5**], the patient had a
self-extubation which failed.  He was reintubated and
experienced likely intubation-associated pneumonia.  His
sputum grew out Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
He was started on Vancomycin.  He had a bedside tracheostomy
performed and has since that time been slowly able to be
weaned from the ventilator.  He, at this time, is able to be
weaned to tracheostomy mask for three to four hours per day.

2.  Infectious disease - The patient had 2 out of 2 positive
blood cultures from a left subclavian line that was
discontinued and he was started on Vancomycin.  His
peripheral cultures remained no growth deep.  He had
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and has
been treated with Vancomycin to complete a two week course.

3.  Heme - The patient received one unit of blood.  His
hematocrit remained stable.  His platelets initially
decreased but later recovered and have since then been
normal.  It was felt that he had likely consumption from his
large clot burden as well as poor production given his recent
chemotherapy.  He was therapeutic on heparin and Coumadin was
started prior to discharge.

4.  Renal - Initially the patient had his creatinine bumped
to 2.5, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis from his
arrest and also in the setting of large diload for computed
tomographic angiography and angiogram.  His creatinine
trended down.  He had good urine output and his kidney
function was normal at the time of discharge.

5.  Gastrointestinal - He initially had elevated liver
function tests which recovered over his initial hospital
stay.  It was felt this was secondary to shock liver.  He
also had coffee ground emesis through his nasogastric tube
after his total parenteral alimentation.  He was started on
Protonix and he had no further bleeding.  At the time of
discharge he was having normal bowel movements that were
guaiac negative.

6.  Nutrition - The patient was started on tube feeds via his
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy that was placed at the
bedside by Gastroenterology.  He was tolerating them well.

7.  Cardiovascular - The patient remained off of his
antihypertensive medications during his hospital stay.  These
can be restarted as needed after discharge.

8.  Access - The patient will be evaluated for a PICC line to
be placed prior to discharge to complete his course of
antibiotics.  He has a tracheostomy and percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

The remaining discharge summary will be dictated as an
addendum with discharge medications.

Service:

ADDENDUM TO HOSPITAL COUSRE:  The patient was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service on [**3-6**] of [**2106**] and remained in
stable condition.  He was continued on Zosyn for presumptive
pneumonia and remained afebrile.  His white blood cells
counts also went down to 10 on the day prior to discharge.
He had no signs of active infection on the day of discharge.
Given his cardiac arrest on presentation he also had been
evaluated by the Electric Physiology Consult Service in the
hospital.  It was thought that his initial cardiac arrest was
most likely secondary to pulmonary causes.  Since the initial
stress was most likely sinus bradycardia.  He had a repeat
echocardiogram on the day prior to his discharge.  The full
reports will follow.  The left atrium is normal in size.  The
right atrium is moderately dilated.  A small secundum, atrial
septal defect is present.  There is mild symmetrical left
ventricular hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size is
normal.  Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed, ejection fraction estimated to be 345
to 40%.  Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
septal inferolateral and inferior hypokinesis.  Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.  The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.  1+ aortic regurgitation is seen.  Mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened, 1+ mitral regurgitation is
seen.  There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  There is no pericardial effusion.  He also
went for EP study on the day prior to his discharge, which
showed only 9% polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.
Therefore there is no indication for defibrillator placement.
 Given his persistently high blood pressure in the hospital
antihypertensive medication had been titrated up.  He was
discharged on Metoprolol 50 mg po b.i.d., Lisinopril 20 mg po
q day and Norvasc 5 mg po q day for blood pressure control.
Since he suffered acute renal failure on presentation it is
important to follow his creatinine level until it returns to
normal.  On the day prior to discharge his creatinine level
was down to 1.8.  During this hospital stay his creatinine
level was up to 2.5 on [**3-3**].

The day prior to discharge the patient also complained of
frequent bowel movements, however, C-diff was still pending
on the day of discharge.  Since the patient is also on
multiple laxatives it would be wise to hold the bowel regimen
while the patient has diarrhea.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post cardiac arrest.
2.  Status post intubation.
3.  Pneumonia.
4.  Urinary tract infection.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Diabetes.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Augmentin 500/125 po b.i.d. for four
more days for a total of a ten day course, Metoprolol 50 mg
po b.i.d. held for systolic blood pressure less then 100 and
heart rate less then 55.  Lisinopril 20 mg po q day held for
systolic blood pressure less then 100.  Norvasc 5 mg po q day
hold for systolic blood pressure less then 100.  Aspirin 325

DIET:  Diabetic and cardiac healthy diet.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
congestive heart failure clinic on [**3-29**] of [**2106**] at 10:00
a.m.  The patient will also follow up at the [**Hospital 191**] clinic in
one month.  The patient will call for an appointment.  The
phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**] was given.  Other follow up
instructions the rehab facility was asked to check the BUN
and creatinine level and titrate up blood pressure medication
as needed for a goal systolic blood pressure 120 to 130.  The
patient's daily weight and ins and outs should also be
followed up closely.  Po daily Lasix may be needed if the
patient appeared to be fluid overloaded.  The patient's
previous oral hypoglycemics may also be restarted once the
renal function improved.

CXR ([**2108-5-7**]):
Endotracheal tube placement as described. Evidence for
development of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

CT HEAD ([**2108-5-7**]):
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute major vascular
territorial infarction.MRI would be more sensitive for acute
ischemia.

CARDIAC CATH ([**2108-5-7**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no evidence of acute thrombus or flow-limiting coronary artery
disease.
The LMCA was free of critical stenoses. The LAD had a 30% lesion
in the
mid-vessel and 50% stenosis in the D1 branch. The LCx was widely
patent.
The RCA had a 30% lesion in the mid-vessel.
2. Limited views were obtained in an effort to conserved IV dye
given
(30cc) the patient's history of multiple myeloma and chronic
renal
insufficiency.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated right and
left
heart filling pressures with a mean RA of 14mmHg and mean PCWP
of
21mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 3.0 l/min/m2. There
was
systemic arterial hypertension with an aortic SBP of 155mmHg.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Vfib arrest
2. Coronary arteries without acute thrombus or flow limiting
disease
3. Moderate diastolic biventricular dysfunction.

ECHO ([**2108-5-8**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
The basal inferolateral wall may be akinetic/hypokinetic but is
not well visualized. Views are technically
suboptimal for assessment of left ventricular function but
global LV systolic function appears grossly preserved. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen in suboptimal views. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen
in suboptimal views. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. s/p VF arrest:
Patient had a witnessed syncopal event, found to be in VF arrest
by EMS and shocked with 360J x1; after shock, was in paced
rhythm with no recurrant episodes of vfib thereafter.  Regarding
etiology, there was no clear precipitant as cardiac cath showed
no suspect lesions and while his Troponin was elevated, his
CK-MB was not and his renal disease may confound the utility of
troponin.  The echo showed no obvious structural cause.
Electrolytes found within normal limits and while the QRS was
mildly long, it was not felt to be causitive.

On the evening of admission, the patient was started on Artic
Sun cooling x24 hours.  While being rewarmed his blood pressure
was transiently low (into 60s systolic) requiring levophed for a
short time ([**Date range (1) 4479**] AM).

He was extubated on [**5-9**], uneventfully and did well from a
respiratory standpoint thereafer.  Neurology followed and felt
that his initial exam was re-assuring (intact pupillary, gag and
corneal with movement of BL lower extremities).  His neurologic
exam improved throughout his course.

On [**5-17**], an ICD was added to the patient's existing pacemaker
(his ventricular lead was removed and replaced with a pacing/ICD
wire leaving him with 2 wires).

2. Coronary artery disease:
No significant coronary disease was seen on cath to explain VF
arrest.  Continued on aspirin, statin and beta-blocker.

3. Pump:
Echo performed was a suboptimal study, but the LV function
appeared normal.

4. Diminshed level of consciousness
As above, neurologic status on arrival with brainstem reflexes
intact (pupillary, gag, corneal) was reassuring.  Head CT
negative for bleed, CVA, edema or herniation.  Two days after
admission, he was awake (while intubated) and had tracking eye
movements.  He was not initially following commands.  He quickly
improved over the next days and was alert and oriented to
person, place but did not know the date at the time of
discharge.  Follow-up with behavioral neurology was scheduled.

5. Acute on chronic kidney disease:
Underlying renal disease felt to be secondary to amyloidosis and
light chain disease in setting of multiple myeloma.  Presented
above baseline of 3.0, at 3.8.  This improved after resucitation
and IVF, but worsened (up to 4.4) after hypotensive episode.
Renal was consulted and saw many muddy brown casts, indicitive
of ATN.  He had only recieved 30cc of dye at cath, so this was
not felt to be a contributor.  He was oliguric for one day (UO
~500cc), but thereafter made good urine.  His creatinine
continued to improve and was 3.4 on discharge.

6. Multiple Myeloma:
Discussed with outpt oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who believed his MM is
in remission.  Last BM biopsy [**2108-4-30**] which did not show evidence
of MM.  Controlled on weekly Dexamethasone and daily Thalidomide
which were held during the admission.

8. Hyperlipidemia and hypertension:  Continued statin;
metoprolol was held during hypotensive episode, but restarted
thereafter.

9. Diabetes:  Held antihypoglycemics and covered with sliding
scale insulin.

10. Anemia:  Hematocrit 35.2 on admission and trended down
during stay.  Partly a component of daily phlebotomy.  Did have
OB positive OG output and was placed on IV PPI for a time; this
was transitioned to PO PPI.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 67-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure,
biventricular failure, ejection fraction 20-30% resulting in
[**1-1**] at a nursing home unresponsive, pulseless and
apneic.  Sick care was initiated, airway was opened and
revealed copious emesis in oropharynx which was suctioned.
Respiratory rate at that time was 1-2 breaths per minute.
Paddles revealed rhythm with PEA at rate of 25-50 beats per
minute.  Peeping was initiated at 70 beats per minute.  He
was intubated in the field and brought promptly to the
He received a total of epinephrine 2 mg, atropine 4 mg.
Arterial blood gas assist control with a rate of 20, tidal
volume 600, PEEP 5, FIO2 100% revealed an arterial blood gas
of 7.28, 47, 77.  He was hypotensive and dopamine was
initiated bring systolic blood pressure up to the 140.  His
baseline is in the 80s.

Laboratories revealed a potassium of 6.9.  He was given
insulin and calcium and a repeat potassium was 6.4.
Electrocardiogram revealed peaked T waves.  Dopamine was
stopped with systolic blood pressure in the 120s, then
propofol was initiated for sedation for ventilation and his
systolic blood pressure decreased to 70.  Dopamine was
restarted, however, patient developed frequent nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia so dopamine was stopped and
Neo-Synephrine was started with resolution of ectopy.
Patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

PEA arrest was felt most likely secondary to hyperkalemia,
however, it is also possible that a primary cardiac event
resulting in tissue necrosis causing a elevated potassium.
Medical Intensive Care Unit course was notable for patient
was initially unresponsive with dilated fixed pupils, but by
hospital day number two, his mental status cleared and
patient was back to baseline.  His vent was weaned and the
patient was extubated.  He was discharged on vancomycin,
levofloxacin and Flagyl to cover for possible aspiration
pneumonia and line infection given an elevated white blood
cell count.  His abdomen was distended and tense, but
baseline, so no studies were pursued.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

Medical Intensive Care Unit course:  As noted in the history
of present illness, patient was initiated on vancomycin,
levofloxacin, Flagyl antibiotics for presumed aspiration
pneumonia and line infection.  Questionable line was
discontinued and central access was obtained.  He was
continued on Neo-Synephrine until his blood pressure
stabilized to his baseline with systolic blood pressure of
80-90.  He was weaned off the ventilator and was extubated on
[**1-2**].  His neurological improvement was miraculous from
his presentation with dilated fixed pupils to his
conversational alert and oriented status upon discharge.

Hospital course notable for:

1.  CVS:  Dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction
20-30%.  He was not started on a beta-blocker and ACE
inhibitor because of his low systolic blood pressure.

2.  Coronary artery disease:  On enteric coated aspirin.
Laboratories revealed CKs 281, 357, 259, 294, with elevated
MB 16, 17, 26 and 20 with indices 7.1, 7.3, 6.6, 5.4 and
troponins less than 0.3 times four. The elevated CK-MB with
normal troponin was felt most likely secondary to CPR,
however, he does have known coronary artery disease.  Rate
and rhythm:  He was monitored on telemetry and had no events.

3.  Pulmonary:  He was extubated on [**2120-1-2**].  He was
doing well, saturating on room air in the high 90s.  He was
initially noted to have subcutaneous air in the anterior
chest wall and complained of significant right rib pain; felt
to be secondary to a rib fracture from the CPR.  He was given
Tylenol and Toradol for the pain.  He was treated for
presumed aspiration pneumonia given chest x-ray and elevated
white blood cell count with metronidazole 500 mg po q. 8
hours times a seven day course and levofloxacin 500 mg q. 48
hours for seven days.

4.  Renal:  Patient continued to receive hemodialysis for
volume overload.  Calcium acetate was added for an elevated
phosphate.  Hyperkalemia resolved.  He received his final
hemodialysis on the morning of discharge, Saturday, [**2120-1-6**] and will resume his outpatient Monday, Wednesday,
Friday hemodialysis upon discharge.

5.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was initially started on
vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl to cover for both
aspiration pneumonia and femoral line infection given that
femoral line was placed in unsterile conditions.  However,
culture, a central line tip revealed no growth to date so
vancomycin was stopped.  Flagyl and levofloxacin were
continued for a seven day course.  Patient remained afebrile.
Blood cultures showing no growth to date and tip culture
showing no growth to date.

6.  Neurological:  Mental status cleared significantly but
patient still with confusion worse than baseline per his
wife.  [**Name (NI) **] was ordered for Haldol, however, while on the
floor, did not require any for agitation.  He was restarted
on Zoloft 100 mg po q.d. per home regimen.  Narcotics were
avoided given patient's history of confusion with them.

7.  Gastrointestinal:  Patient with ascites secondary to
congestive heart failure.  He has required paracentesis in
the past, however, he is currently without pain and is not
complaining of pain and, therefore, therapeutic tap was felt
to be not useful.

8.  Code status:  Family meeting occurred and patient was
made ""Do Not Resuscitate, Do Not Intubate.""  He was
discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**] on [**2120-1-6**] to complete
his course of antibiotics and to continue care.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  PEA arrest.
2.  Hyperkalemia, resolved.
3.  Intubation for respiratory failure.
4.  Aspiration pneumonia.
5.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.
6.  Right rib fracture.
7.  Coronary artery disease.
8.  Abdominal ascites.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Amiodarone 200 mg po q.d.
2.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d.
3.  Levofloxacin 250 mg po q. 48 hours times a seven day
course.
4.  Flagyl 500 mg po t.i.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
6.  Calcium carbonate.
7.  Epoetin q.hd.
8.  Allopurinol 100 mg po q.d.
9.  Sertraline 100 mg po q.d.
10. >....< 300 mg po b.i.d.
11. Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
12. Dulcolax prn.
13. Robitussin prn.

FOLLOW-UP:  Patient will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5762**] at [**Hospital3 7511**].

Reports-
head CT with and without contrast [**2151-3-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial pathology.
2. Encephalomalacia of the right occipital pole with associated
ex vacuo
dilatation of the right lateral ventricular occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
suggestive of prior cerebral injury.
================================
Chest CTA [**2151-3-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Small left pneumothorax, likely related to acute left rib
fractures. Other rib deformities are bilateral.
2. Bibasilar and peribronchial opacities, could be due to
massive aspiration, associated with atelectasis.
3. Severe cardiomegaly with marked enlargement of right atrium
and right
ventricle in this patient with known Ebstein malformation and
prior sternotomy for tricuspid plasty.
4. Mediastinal lipomatosis.
5. Venous shunt between the right and the middle hepatic veins,
could be due to old Budd-Chiari disease. Tiny filling defect in
the abnormal connection could be branching vessels or thrombus,
likely old.
.
================================
[**2151-3-7**] CT chest
IMPRESSION:
1. No residual pneumothorax in the upper two-thirds of the
chest. One
residual air bubble in the mediastinum. No chest tube was
installed.
2. No other change since earlier today.
================================
CT chest [**2151-3-13**]- IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal fluid collection.
2. Basal pulmonary consolidation with small pleural effusions.
3. Mediastinal lipomatosis.
4. Right adrenal myelolipoma.
5. Evidence of previous right hip AVN.
.
Echo with bubble study
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left and atrial and right appendage emptying
velocities are depressed (<0.2m/s). The intra-atrial septum is
thickened consistent with prior ASD closure surgery. No residual
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness and cavity size are grossly normal.
The apex is heavily trabeculated. Systolic function could not be
adequately assessed. Th e systolic function appears depressed.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with marked free wall
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta to 45cm from the incisors. The descending aorta
is relatively small, but no coarctation or dissection is seen.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. The tricuspid annular ring is identified and appears well
seated. Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No atrial septal defect by 2D or color Doppler. Well
seated tricuspid annular ring with mild-moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Severe right ventricular cavity enlargement with
depressed biventricular systolic function.
.
Cardiac MRI:Impression:
1. Normal left ventricular cavity size with globally depressed
systolic function. The LVEF was severely decreased at 28%. No MR
evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction although images
technically suboptimal. Prominent non-compacted left ventricular
myocardium that meet CMR criteria for non-compaction.
2. Abnormal and apically displaced tricuspid valve consistent
with Ebstein's anomaly. A tricuspid annulplasty ring was
present. Moderately depressed systolic function of the
functional right ventricle with RVEF at 25%. Abnormal septal
motion consistent with right ventricular pressure / volume
overload. Markedly dilated inferior vena cava and hepatic veins
consistent with elevated
right atrial pressure.
3. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate-to-severe tricuspid
regurgitation through tricuspid leaflets of functional right
ventricle. Severe tricuspid regurgitation through tricuspid
annulus of structural right ventricle. 4. The indexed diameters
of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were
normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter index was normal.
5. Biatrial enlargement.
.
Chest x-ray [**2151-3-17**] - IMPRESSION: 1. Stable appearance of the
mediastinum and cardiac silhouette. 2. Status post extubation.
No evidence of atelectasis.
.
EKG [**2151-3-26**]- Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is prolonged. Left
axis deviation. Right bundle-branch block with left anterior
fascicular block. There are Q waves in the inferior leads
consistent with prior infarction. There is an abnormal
precordial transition consistent with possible prior anterior
myocardial infarction. Low voltage in the precordial leads.
Compared to the previous tracing the P-R interval is longer.


Brief Hospital Course:
39M w/ pmh of ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve
reconstruction, right and left sided systolic congestive heart
failure, presenting with unstable ventricular tachycardia, s/p
resuscitation with return to sinus tachycardia, s/p intubation
and extubation.
.
# Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of natural history of
ebstein anomaly.  Patient underwent CPR and intubation with
return to normal sinus rhythm. Suppressed ectopy with
Amiodarone. Also started metoprolol for rate-control. Amiodarone
increased to 200mg TID. Had cardiac MRI with final read as
above. Patient then underwent EP study where they were unable to
induce ventricular fibrillation so unable to ablate. EP was
unable to place an ICD during this admission given recent
procedure and significant abnormal heart anatomy.  Patient to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2-12**] weeks to discuss possible
ICD placement in the future.  In addition, patient to have
monitor set up at home as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
#Respiratory Failure - Now resolved.  Initially primarily
hypoxemic, with unclear etiology. Differential includes ARDS,
PNA/sepsis, shunt, and volume overload. Improvement with nitric
oxide suggested some shunt physiology, although intracardiac
shunt was not evident on TEE. Respiratory failure improved with
diuresis. Decreased Fi02 and PEEP and nitric oxide weaned off
with improved compliance. Methemaglobin negative. Multifactorial
secondary to CHF, OSA, and restrictive ventilation due to
habitus.  Required mechanical ventilation from admission
(intubated during V Fib arrrest in ED), and extubated on
[**2151-3-16**], without difficulty. Since, patient has been satting
well on room air using CPAP at night.
.
#Hypotension (resolved): Initially secondary to VT, in addition
probably contribution from sedatives, positive pressure
ventilation especially in the setting of marked RV dysfunction.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be intravscularly volume depleted, but total body
overloaded.  Sepsis less likely at this point, given broad
spectrum antibiotic coverage, negative culture data, although
stil febrile.  Patient initially on 3-pressors which were weaned
off.  In terms of sepsis work-up all culture data negative,
although patient was treated empirically for VAP.  Initially
held all blood pressure medications including beta blocker and
ACE inhibitor which were restarted slowly after hypotension had
resolved.
.
# Fevers: Leukocytosis/fever/right lobe infiltrate- Patient felt
to have likely aspiration PNA with witnessed emesis during
intubation. Cultures were all negative.  Femoral line was
removed and sent for culture.  Given negative culture data,
patient was treated for VAP and then there was concern that
possible drug fever given persistant fever and no positive
culture data. Fevers improved after patient was extubated and
did not recur.
.
# Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Has right sided
heart failure only, s/p tricuspid reconstruction and ASD repair.
Patint on low dose metoprolol and lisinopril as above, cont
aspirin 325. Initially  held statin in the setting of worsening
liver abnormalities but restarted as LFTs improved. Continued
patient's outpatient lasix dose of 40 mg Po daily once blood
pressures had improved.
.
# Pain: has left sided chest wall pain [**3-15**] fractured ribs from
resuscitation.  Patient was treated with Lidocaine patch daily
as well as standing Tylenol. Patient was discharged on tylenol
PRN.
.
#Gout: Patient as outpatient on colchicine and allopurinol
although patient not taking allopurinol at home. Initially
concern that fever may be secondary to gout.  Patient was tapped
and tap revealed WBC, Joint Fluid 300* #/uL 0 - 150
RBC, Joint Fluid [**Numeric Identifier 1871**]* #/uL 0 - 0 Polys 80* % 0 - 25
Lymphocytes 4 % 0 - 75
Monocytes 0 % 0 - 70 Macrophage 16 % 0 - 70 FEW SIDEROTIC
GRANULES PRESENT
Joint Crystals, Number NO[**Serial Number **]. Patient states that he is having
pain in his right knee which he thinks is from his gout. Given
improvement in renal function and patient's request restarted
colchicine at outpatient dose.
.
# Anemia -  patient with Cr 31 currently previous baseline 41.
Patient has not had anemia labs checked. Added on anemia labs to
discharge labs. Patient will require active type and screen

History of Present Illness:
55 y/o M with CAD s/p stents, [**Hospital 23051**] transferred from [**Hospital1 9191**] after hypoxia and PEA arrest. Per family, the patient
was driving at 2am to pick up his daughter. [**Name (NI) **] en route, he
stopped by the side of the road to urinate. While urinating he
became incontinent of stool, and developed acute onset of
dyspnea, and fell to the ground. ststing "" I can't breathe and I
feel like I'm going to die"". EMS was called. BS 276 in the
field.  Per family report, while being transported to [**Hospital1 **] the
patient arrested and was resucitated by EMS. However, there was
no documentation of this in EMS log.  Rhythm strip from
ambulance showed  ST depressions V3-V5. No evidence of
hyperkalemia on EKG, PR and QTc within normal limits.   Pt was
tachycardiac to 117 with sat of 80-87% on 100% NRB.
.
On arrival to the OSH,  he was bradycardic at 40, O2 75%,
underwent CPR for two minutes, epinephrine X2, atropine 1 amp
X1, HCO3 2 amps. Post arrest his HR was in the 120's and blood
pressure in the 140s, and he was placed on nitro gtt.  At [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] his ekg showed anterolateral ST depressions, in setting of
hyperkalemia and respiratory acidosis. CXR showed fluid overload
and he was given 40mg lasix IV. BNP 97.  Initial blood gas at
OSH, 6.87/73/76 satting 100% on NRB.  Repeast [**Doctor Last Name **] 50 minutes
later 6.91/88/95 now intubated.  UA negative He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED because apparently his records are here.
.
In the ED here vitals were: 123 117/87 100% on FiO2 100%.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with rightward axis, st depressions
in I, V3-V5. CT head was normal, CTA torso was remarkable for
large bilateral aspirations but no PE or aortic dissection.
Cards was consulted in the ED and felt ekg changes were likely
secondary to hypoxia and acidemia, and given no evidence STEMI,
VF, or VT, cath was not indicated at this time and MICU
admission was appropriate. Labs showed K of 6.8, lactate of 3.3.
 He was given vancomycin and zosyn. He was started on the arctic
sun cooling protocol as well, and transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, patient's CK and troponin continued to rise.  ECHO
showed severaly depressed EF of 20%, both left and right
ventricular dilitation, and inferolateral akinesis and mid to
distal anteroseptal and apical akinesis with hypokinesis
elsewhere.

structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is at least mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

Bilateral Lower Extremity Doppler US [**2164-5-2**] - No evidence of
DVT in the lower extremities bilaterally

Cardiac Cath [**2164-5-4**] - 1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrated left main and three vessel CAD. The
LMCA had an ostial 60% stenosis and diffuse mild narrowing. The
LAD had diffuse 80% proximal and mid stenoses and 60% mid-distal
stenosis. The LCx had a diffuse 99% stenosis that tracked back
to the LMCA. The RCA had a mid 60% stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial blood
pressure with SBP 114mmHg and DBP 73mmHg.


Brief Hospital Course:
55M who was admitted with PEA arrest and NSTEMI. He was
successfully cooled with the Arctic Sun and extubated with
return
of excellent mental status. Echo showed biventricular
dilatation and EF 20% with multiple wall motion abnormalities.
Cath revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  He
is
on broad spectrum antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia, which
improved significantly within 2-3 days.
Mr. [**Known lastname 39793**] was transferred to the cardiac surgery service for
coronary artery bypass after undergoing the routine preoperative
workup.  The patient was brought to the operating room on
[**2164-5-7**] where the patient underwent coronary artery bypass x 4.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin was
used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis given his preoperative
stay of greater than 24 hours.  POD 1 found the patient
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The
patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable
weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  Coumadin was initiated for atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry
floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #4 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics. Coumadin follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
set up and VNA is to call INR levels to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21566**] for
Coumadin dosing instructions (goal INR 1.5-2.5) for left atrial
thrombus.  The patient was cleared for discharged to home in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

Service:  MEDICAL ICU/CARDIOLOGY SERVICE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was admitted to the MICU
service after a code.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
male with diabetes, borderline hypertension, with a three
week history of nocturnal cough elicited when supine as well
as recent peripheral edema who presented to the Emergency
Room with the complaint of fatigue, malaise, and collapse in
the Triage Area.

After collapse, the patient was found to be ashen in color,
unresponsive.  Paddle showed questionable artifact versus
ventricular fibrillation.  The patient was shocked and went
into sinus bradycardia and was given epinephrine and
Atropine.  She went into wide complex tachycardia that seemed
to be a left bundle branch block supraventricular
tachycardia.  He was shocked three times.  He was given
Amiodarone 300 mg.  He went into sinus tachycardia.  The
patient was intubated after the first shock.  D50 was given
during the code.  The ABG was 7.20, 49, 93, 16.  After
intubation, the ABG improved to 7.31, 37, 242, and 20.

The family reports a three week history of dry cough at night
when supine.  No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He slept on
two pillows.  He has had recent leg edema bilaterally for the
last several days.  He also had shortness of breath on the
morning of admission.  He denied any fevers or chills, no
nausea, vomiting, or chest pain.

After the code, the patient's heart rate was 110, blood
pressure 232/110, glucose 451.  Cardiology did a bedside
echocardiogram that showed good wall motion.  The patient was
taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory emergently
which showed moderate elevated right and left-sided filling
pressures, high-normal cardiac index, mild anterolateral
hypokinesis of the LV.  No mitral regurgitation.  EF of about
50%.  Pulmonary wedge pressure was 25.  There was 80%
stenosis in the small third diagonal and 80% in the ostium of
the oblique marginal II, but otherwise diffuse disease.  PA
pressures were 40 systolic, 18 diastolic, with a mean of 28.
The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was again 25.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes.
2.  Borderline hypertension.
3.  Recent peripheral edema.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amaryl 400 q.d.
2.  Glucophage 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother had [**Name (NI) 2481**].  No
other known family history.  He is a former smoker, quit 30
years ago.  Occasional alcohol.  He is a retired tailor.  He
is married with several children.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient
was afebrile on admission.  Temperature 98.2, blood pressure
115/59, heart rate 47, respiratory rate 20, assist control of
60%, tidal volume of 750, rate 20, PEEP 5 with ABG
7.47/24/165/18, saturating 99%.  He was sedated and
intubated.  HEENT:  The pupils were equally round and
reactive to light.  The conjunctivae were pale.  No
lymphadenopathy.  No JVD.  Neck:  He had tinea on the neck.
Lungs: Bronchial sounds at the left base, otherwise his PMI
was in the midclavicular line in the fifth intercostal space.
Cardiovascular:  He was bradycardiac, regular rhythm, S1, S2,
a soft I/VI systolic murmur, split S2.  Abdomen:  Soft, no
hepatomegaly, nontender.  Extremities:  He had 1+ edema
bilaterally in the lower extremities.  No clubbing or
cyanosis.  He had 1+ DP pulses bilaterally, palpable PT
pulses bilaterally.  He had fungal nail infections.  He had
four peripheral IVs, right femoral venous, and arterial
sheaths.  Neurological:  He had positive Babinski's
bilaterally.  He was sedated.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Chemistries:  Sodium 135,
potassium 4.8, chloride 104, bicarbonate 19, BUN and
creatinine 29 and 1.5, glucose 451.  Corrected sodium was
141.  ALT and AST 19 and 22.  CK 163, troponin less than 0.3,
amylase 63.  He had a white count of 18.6, hematocrit 31.0,
platelets 251,000.  He had a left shift, 93% neutrophils.

The EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 66 beats per minute,
normal axis, normal PR interval.  He had a left bundle branch
block with T wave inversion in V5 and V6, T wave inversion in
aVL and I.

Chest x-ray showed increased interstitial markings,
cardiomegaly.  Air bronchogram right greater than left.  No
focal consolidations at that time.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was treated for presumed
pneumonia.  He was started on levofloxacin on [**2106-2-25**] and
proceeded to have increased thick tannish secretions.  He
continued to spike fevers despite levofloxacin and was
started on vancomycin on [**2106-2-28**] to cover for line
infection.  His central line was changed at that time and
vancomycin was also to cover for any resistant strains of
Streptococcus that might have caused his pneumonia.

The patient continued to spike fevers despite vancomycin and
levofloxacin.  The levofloxacin was changed to Zosyn on
[**2106-3-3**] and the patient defervesced after that.
Vancomycin was stopped on [**2106-3-5**] due to lack of
any resistant organisms growing from the cultures.  All
cultures were essentially negative or pending at the time of
transfer from the MICU.

In terms of the patient's respiratory status, the patient
maintained good 02 saturation with good ABG on pressure
support, decreased secretions.  He was extubated.  He had a
sympathetic surge.  He became tachycardiac and hypertensive
and then had flash pulmonary edema and was hypoxic to the 70s
and had to be reintubated on [**2106-2-26**].

The patient was then aggressively diuresed and continued on
IV antibiotics and was extubated on [**2106-3-4**].

In terms of the patient's congestive heart failure, an
echocardiogram was done on the night of [**2106-2-25**] showing
moderate to severe depressed LV function with an EF of 30%.
However, a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to assess the
patient's hemodynamics and it revealed a high wedge with
cardiac output of [**9-22**].  A systemic vascular resistance of
about 500-550 with a mixed venous 02 saturation of 76-79%.
It was consistent with a more distributive picture.  It
showed good cardiac output.  The Swan-Ganz catheter was
discontinued.  The patient continued to be aggressively
diuresed to bring his wedge pressure down.

The patient diuresed well to IV Lasix but needed increasing
doses of up to 80 mg IV b.i.d.  The patient was also started
on nitroglycerin and hydralazine for preload and afterload
reduction and for blood pressure control.  He continued to be
hypertensive at times.  He was also started on metoprolol
after significant diuresis for rate control and for his heart
failure and coronary artery disease.

When his renal function improved, he was started on Captopril
to transition from Hydralazine to Captopril.  The
nitroglycerin drip was discontinued.

In terms of his acute renal failure, his urinalysis revealed
muddy brown casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis
which was thought to be secondary to the hypotensive episode
on presentation to the Emergency Room as well as to the large
dye load during cardiac catheterization.  His creatinine
continued to improve despite aggressive diuresis, proving
good cardiac flow to the kidneys.  His Zosyn dose was
increased with improving creatinine clearance.

Other issues during the hospital course were his anemia.  The
patient was found to have a drop in hematocrit from 33 to 27
post catheterization.  He was given a total of [**2-15**] units of
packed red blood cells throughout the hospital stay.
Hemolysis workup was negative.  A CAT scan of the abdomen
ruled out any retroperitoneal bleed.  The patient's
hematocrit remained stable throughout the rest of the
hospital course.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2106-3-6**]
to the Cardiology Service to be followed-up.  The plan was
also to get an Electrophysiology evaluation to assess for any
possible tachycardiac/bradycardiac arrhythmias.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
S/p Vfib arrest and MVA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
Arctic Sun Cooling s/p intubation


History of Present Illness:
67M s/p single car MVC found to be in cardiac arrest, with
subsequent re-suscitation. Per ED report via the PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
patient called his PCP earlier in the day complaining of chest
pain and was driving to his PCP office when he hit a tree. His
wife, who saw him early this morning says that he had never
complained of chest pain in the past. However, the dog walker
did say he was confused this morning, forgetting that his mother
in law had recently passed away.  He drove to the PCP and
crashed his car.  Per EMS evaluation after the crash he was in
ventricular fibrillation, was shocked once and became asystolic.
He was intubated, given one amp of epinephrine and converted to
atrial fibrillation. After this he was moving his extremities
but not following commands.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, trauma evalution was unremarkable: the patient
had a negative CT head, C-spine, Pelvis, Chest, Abdomen. GCS
before intubation was 3. Patient received Succinylcholine,
Etomidate for intubation and was placed on a propofol drip; and
he received 3L IVF. He was then cooled with icepacks with for
therapeutic hypothermia with the Arctic Sun protocol.

Vitals on transfer to MICU were T36.7 HR 96 RR 15 BP 148/108
O2sat 100% on ventilator. He was continued on propofol and
placed on Arctic Sun. EKG showed atrial fibrillation with RBBB,
ST elevation in I and avF with ST depressions in V1-V3,
indicating postero-lateral ischemia.

He had an initial Echo which showed EF 50% with normal left
ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction
c/w CAD (PDA distribution). He went for cardiac catheterization
at this point, which showed an OM1 occlusion and had MiniVision
2.5 X 23 BMS stent placed for re-perfusion.

Per wife, patient has history of
Hypothyroidism
Depression.

He has no significant cardiac history.
No CAD, HTN or hypercholesterolemia.

Studies:

[**10-6**] ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior
and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA
distribution).

[**10-6**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
two
vessel coronary artery disease, with occlusion of the OM1 branch
of the
LCX.  The LMCA and LAD had minimal lumen irregularities.  The
LCX had an
OM branch that was occluded in the mid-portion.  The RCA was
patent with
a 60% stenosis in the distal portion.
2. Successful PTCA/Stenting of occluded OM1 with 2.5 X 23
MiniVision
baremetal stent at 12 atms with 0% residual, normal flow and no
dissection.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful placement of 2.5 X 23 mm MiniVision baremetal
stent in
OM1.

[**10-6**] CT C-spine:
IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment. Mild degenerative
changes.  Biapical lung opacity, likely due to aspiration.

[**10-6**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.

[**10-6**] CT Pelvis/Abdomen/Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No traumatic injury.
2. Scattered lung opacity, likely due to aspiration.
3. Bladder stone.
4. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
5. Atrophic right kidney.

[**10-9**] Bilateral Lower Extremities U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of
DVT.

EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study because of
marked to
severe diffuse background slowing and disorganization. These
findings
are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is
etiologically non-specific. At least some of the changes are
likely due
to medication effect and effects of hypothermia. There were no
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. Continued
evaluation of EEG as the patient is re-warmed will provide
additional
prognostic information.

[**10-15**]: MRI of Brain
No infarct, hemorrhage or mass. Ventricles, cisterns and sulci
are age appropriate.   Very mild, scattered T2/Flair
hyperintensities within the cerebral white matter represent
underlying mild chronic microvascular age-related changes.
Major intracranial flow voids are preserved.  The osseous and
extracranial soft tissue structures are significant for only
partial opacification of the bilateral mastoid air cells, which
may be related to recent intubation.
Impression: No acute intracranial abnormality


Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old male with s/p posterolateral STEMI causing VF arrest
and MVA, now s/p BMS to OM1 on [**10-6**] with improving altered
mental status.

#VF arrest after OM1 occlusion:  Patient with no history of
cardiac disease s/p VF arrest in the field resulting in
intubation and transfer.  EKG showed atrial fibrillation with
RBBB, ST elevation in I and avF with ST depressions in V1-V3,
consistent with postero-lateral infarct. Atrial fibrillation
self converted to a sinus rhythm.  Troponin peaked at 10.84. CK
peaked at 5707 and CKMB peaked at 442.  The patient started on
Arctic Sun cooling protocol and rewarmed. Patient had cardiac
catheterization given EKG changes and an OM1 lesion was stented
with a bare metal stent (please see Cath results above).
Initially, the patient received fluids for blood pressure
support when blood pressure resolved, he was diuresised with
lasix drip. In the setting of hypotension the patient developed
shock liver that resolved in three days.  The patient was
successfully extubated on [**2160-10-10**].
-Continue Plavix 75 mg daily
-Continue ASA 325 mg daily
-Continue metoprolol succinate 100 mg q day
-Continue lisinopril 5 mg q day

# Altered mental status: After rewarming from the cooling
protocol, the patient was acutely agitated and disoriented.  He
required IV Haldol for agitation.  Since that time, he has been
calm, but still confused.  He initially made inappropriate
statements, with tangential and circumferential thinking.
Currently, he is alert and oriented to place, time, and person,
although he remains confused about the time line of his heart
attack.  He had an Head MRI revealing no acute intracranial
abnormalities and will be follow by Neurology as an outpatient.

.
# Aspiration Acquired PNA:  The patient was febrile prior to and
after extubation.  It was believed that he had an aspiration
event prior to being intubated and during his PMA arrest.  His
BC were negative, and his sputum culture grew out Methicillin
sensitive S. Aureus.  He had been placed on cefepime,
vancomycin, and metronidazole for empiric coverage.  However, he
developed a maculopapular rash that was believed to be secondary
to cefepime.  After his sputum culture grew out MSSA he was
placed on linezolid.
- Continue Linezolid for aspiration PNA until [**10-19**].
.
# Urinary retention: Foley was d/c??????d on [**10-13**] and did not urinate
for 10 hours.  Bladder scan revealed 460 cc after attempted
urination.  A straight catheter was attempted and failed to
evacuate more urine.  Patient was able to urinate another 200 cc
and patient refusing foley catheter.  After being transferred to
the floor the patient had 2 PVR showing 400 cc of urine in the
bladder.  At that time he had mild suprapubic discomfort.  His
urinary retention was thought to be secondary to decreased
contraction after being cooled.  He will need to be straight
cathed, and he will need to receive tamsulosin.
- Daily in/out catheterization for urinary retention
- Daily post void residuals
- Tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily
.
# MVA: Sternal pain upon deep inspiration.  [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to
air bag deployment.  Upon arrival to the hospital his initial
trauma evaluation did not reveal any abnormalities.
.
# Afib s/p vfib arrest self-converted into SR: Resolved. Chads
score is Zero.
.
# Acute Renal failure:  While cooled his blood pressure and
urine output were poor.  He required IVF for blood pressure
support.  He then required diuresis, and creatinine peaked at
1.3 but slowly trended down.  During diuresis his FeNa was less
than 1%.  His discharge creatinine was 1.0.
.
# Elevated LFTs: His LFTs were elevated, but trended down.  This
was likely due to shock liver in the setting of v.fib arrest.
.
# Hypothyroid: Throughout his hospital course his Levothyroxine
was continued at 50mcg daily.
.
# Loose Stool: 3 loose bowel movements prior to discharge.
Started on Loperamide.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87034**],

It was a pleasure to care for you at the [**Hospital1 18**]. You were
admitted to the hospital because your heart stopped which you
were driving and you had a car accident. You had a heart attack
which casued your heart to stop beating.  When you arrived at
[**Hospital1 18**], we placed a druge eluting stent to reopen an occluded
artery.  Then, you underwent a special cooling protocol to help
your brain.  You had a breathing tube and a respirator breathed
for you.  We were also concerned that you developed a pneumonia
while you were here and we treated you with antibiotics.  Since
the breathing tube has been removed, you were initially
confused.  Your confusion has decreased, but you continue to
have difficulty making new memories.  This may take time to
resolve.  You are also having difficulty voiding which may be
secondary to brain injury after your heart stopped.  You will
need to be straight cathed in rehab until your bladder is able
to contract again.

The following are new medications that you should start taking:
- Aspirin 325 mg daily
- Plavix 75 mg daily (You must take this medication everyday.
Do not stop taking this until Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] says it is ok to
stop.)
- Atorvastatin 80 mg daily
- Toprol XL 100 mg daily
- Lisinopril 5 mg daily
- Linezolid 600 mg Q12 hours (stop on [**2160-10-19**])

You should continue all the medications you were previously
taking:
- Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
- Celexa 20 mg daily

Please go to all of the followup appointments listed below.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79807**] is a 58 year-old man who suffered a VF arrest while
jogging in a park in [**Location (un) 745**].  There were other joggers nearby
during the arrest who administered immediate CPR.  At the time
of EMS arrival, he was noted to be in VF arrest (9:43 AM); he
received a shock at 200 J and was given amiodorone 300 mg; at
that time he was found to be in asystole and CPR was continued.
A pulse was first noted at 9:49 AM; he was in sinus rhythm.  He
was intubated and cooled with ice packs in the field.
.
In the ED, he was found to be hypotensive and was given IVF
without response; he was started on neosynephrine and given ASA
325.  He was cooled to 35 degrees C and sedated on versed and
fentanyl.  He received vecuronium as muscle paralytic to prevent
shivering.
.
His ECG in the ED showed sinus bradycardia to 52 with normal
axis and LVH by voltage criteria; there were TWI in leads I and
aVL, V1-V2, a right bundaloid pattern, and a prolonged QTc to
500.

Past Medical History:

CORONARY CATHETERIZATION ([**2170-8-7**]):
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated single-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA,
LCX, and
RCA were all without angiographically-apparent flow-limiting
stenoses.
The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis that improved to 30% after
direct
intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerine.
2.  Aortography demonstrated severe aortic regurgitation and
mild
dilatation of the ascending aorta without evidence of
dissection.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single-vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Aortic regurgitation.
..
TTE ([**2170-8-7**]):
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is normal
regional and global biventricular systolic function. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is bicuspid.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. Severe
(4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet
is eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mildly thickened bicuspid aortic valve with severe
eccentric aortic regurgitation directed toward the anterior
mitral leaflet. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
dilated left ventricular and preserved regional/global systolic
function. Moderately dilated aortic root. Borderline pulmonary
hypertension.
.
TEE ([**2170-8-9**]):
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or
right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve has
three leaflets but is functionally bileaflet. Leaflets are
thickened and deformed. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. An eccentric jet of moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen. Functionally bicuspid aortic
valve with thickened leaflets and eccentric, moderate to severe
aortic regurgitation. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.
..
CT HEAD ([**2170-8-7**]):
FINDINGS: There is no intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage,
mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or
hydrocephalus. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
Ventricles, sulci and basal cisterns are unremarkable.
Structures within the posterior fossa are unremarkable. No
suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesion is identified. There
is scattered opacification of ethmoid air cells, and thickening
of the posterior aspect of the left maxillary sinus. Visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are otherwise well
aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality identified.
..
CXR ([**2170-8-14**]):
FINDINGS:  There is a single chamber pacer/AICD in place with
lead terminating in the region of the right ventricle. There is
no pneumothorax.
There is significant interval increase in right lung base
opacity. This
appears to be progressive since [**2170-8-9**]. There is
blunting of the right costophrenic angle. These findings likely
represent a right pleural effusion and given the chronicity of
findings adjacent right lung base pneumonia. The left lung is
unchanged from past studies. There is a large cardiac
silhouette, and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval progression of right lung base opacity, likely
pneumonia.
2. Interval placement of single chamber pacer/AICD with lead in
good
position.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is a 58 year-old man presenting s/p ventricular
fibrillation arrest, now intubated, sedated and paralyzed on
cooling protocol, back in normal sinus rhythm.  The period
between onset of cardiac arrest and restoration of sinus pulse
was approximately 6 minutes, per EMS report.
..
# RHYTHM / VF ARREST:
Shortly after presentation to the emergency room he went to the
cath lab where there was evidence of coronary vasospasm of the
LAD; there were no fixed lesions requiring stenting, only a 30%
fixed stenosis of the LAD (see full catheterization report
above).  Urine toxicology was negative.  Echo showed severe
aortic regurgitation and mild symmetric LVH with preserved
global systolic function.  He was started on a nitro drip for
vasospasm and afterload reduction in the setting of known AI.
He was cooled per neuroprotective protocol post cardiac arrest
and maintained in a hypothermic state for 24 hours.  He was
sedated throughout with Fentanyl and midazolam and paralyzed
with vecuronium to minimize shivering.
.
Twenty-four hours after beginning cooling, his core body
temperature was slowly warmed.  He became increasingly agitated
overnight and on the morning of HD 2, his sedation was weaned
and he was extubated.  Telemetry showed no further episodes of
ventricular dysrhythmia.  The presumed cause for his VF arrest
is coronary artery vasospasm.  It is unclear at this time
whether the (exertional) anginal-type symptoms he describes in
the weeks leading up to this event are also due to vasospasm.
.
During the hospital course, his nitro drip was switched over to
long acting nitro and calcium channel blocker.  An ICD was
placed several days prior to discharge.  He will have follow-up
with his cardiologist at [**Hospital1 112**] as well as follow-up in the [**Hospital **]
clinic at [**Hospital1 18**].
..
# PUMP / VALVES:
An echocardiogram performed in the ED showed normal EF with
severe AI and moderate LV dilation.  Although he was initially
hypotensive in the ED requiring neosynephrine he became
hypertensive in cath lab and his pressor was discontinued.  As
above, there was no significant coronary artery disease and no
regional wall motion abnormalities.  A repeat TTE performed two
days after admission showed normal LV function with EF of >55%
and an aortic valve with three leaflets but functionally
bileaflet; AR was 3+. It is unclear at this time whether his
aortic insufficiency is at all related to his VF arrest.
.
As above, he was continued on afterload reducing agents.  He
will follow-up at [**Hospital1 112**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32963**].  Aortic valve
replacement is being considered.
..
# ISCHEMIA / CAD:
As above, coronary angiography showed a 30% fixed stenosis of
his proximal LAD.  LCx and RCA were unremarkable.  The LAD
coronary vasospasm that likely caused his cardiac arrest was
treated with Imdur and amlodipine.  We continued his home dose
of aspirin 81 mg qday.
.
# RESPIRATORY STATUS / PNEUMONIA:
He was intubated in the field secondary to his cardiac arrest
and continued on ventilation throughout the cooling and
rewarming period.  On HD 2, sedation was weaned and he was
extubated on the morning of HD 3.
.
The night before extubation, he spiked a fever.  Differential at
that time included VAP, aspiration pna, pulmonary embolus, and
endocarditis (given his known valvular disease).  [**12-1**] blood
cultures grew gram positive cocci (later speciated as coag neg
staph), and he was started empirically on IV vanco.  A
tranesophageal echo was done while he was still intubated that
was negative for valvular vegetations.  CXR came back showing
bibasilar consolidations c/w aspiration pna.  We started him
empirically on Zosyn and continued the vanco.  When blood
culture speciation returned and he began tolerating PO, IV vanco
and Zosyn were stopped and he was started on levo and flagyl to
complete a seven day course of antibiotics.
.
Unfortunately, on day 7 of his antibiotic course he spiked a
low-grade fever to 100.6, then on day 8 to 101.1.  Repeat CXR,
PA and lateral, showed worsening RLL pneumonia.  Blood and urine
cultures were negative. Infectious disease consultation
recommended increasing dose of levo to 750 QDAY.  We made this
change and decided to treat for an additional 7 days for
presumptive hospital acquired pneiumonia.  He had no more fever
over the next 24 hours.  O2 sats were excellent on RA and there
was no cough or sputum production.  He is discharged with five
days of PO levo remaining to complete a seven day course.
..
# PLEURITIC CHEST PAIN / STATUS POST CHEST COMPRESSIONS:
Chest pain was treated with IV morphine, switched over to
oxycodone post-extubation. This was suppplemented by a lidocaine
patch.  At time of discharge, he is taking vicodin, lidocaine
patch, and NSAIDs with adequate pain control.  Narcotic-related
constipation is treated with senna and docusate.
..
# MENTAL STATUS:
There was concern after extubation that he may have memory
deficits s/p arrest.  CT-head was ordered at admission and
negative for acute intracranial process.  Over the course of the
hospitalization, he became increasingly alert and oriented.  His
MS at time of discharge is fully recovered and back to baseline
pre-arrest.
..
# ANEMIA:
During hospital course, he had hematocrit in mid twenties that
rose to 30 at time of discharge.  Kidney function was normal;
iron studies WNL and hemolysis labs negative.   Unclear why this
otherwise healthy man who runs 20 mi/wk should have anemia,
other than possibly d/t marrow suppression in the setting of
acute illness.  This will need follow-up as outpatient.
..
# After extubation, he was started on a regular diet.  DVT
prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin.  GI ulcer prophylaxis
with an H2 blocker while intubated which was stopped after
extubation.  Code status was full throughout.

Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD placment

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 85008**] is a 47 year old man recently diagnosed with atrial
flutter s/p DCCV x2 as well as ablation, and cardiomyopathy of
unknown etiology (EF15-20%) who is transferred from [**Hospital1 **] after arresting at home and receiving AED shock for
hypothermia protocol.
.
History taken from patient's wife and [**Name (NI) **] note.  In [**2114-6-16**],
Mr. [**Known lastname 85008**] [**Last Name (Titles) 85009**] to PCP's office with fatigue, DOE, and
cough.  He was treated w/ z-pack for bronchitis, but had no
improvement and returned to PCP who then diagnosed him with
""arrhythmia.""  He was sent to [**Hospital3 **] [**6-28**] for
evaluation.  On that admission he was diagnosed with atrial
flutter and ""ischemic"" global cardiomyopathy, moderate RV
hypokinesis, EF of 15-20%, 3-4% MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] his wife, the etiology
of his cardiomyopathy was suspected to be secondary to viral
illness.  He underwent DCCV x2, and was started on amiodarone,
coumadin, toprol, lisinopril, and digoxin.  He subsequently went
back into atrial flutter as an outpatient and was referred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for atrial flutter ablation [**7-20**] (per wife no [**Name2 (NI) **] done at
that time).
.
Since his cardioversion, Mr. [**Known lastname 85008**] had been complaining of
lightheadedness.  He went to see his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27331**]
at Jordin, who stopped his ""blood pressure"" medications.
Otherwise he was doing well since that visit without any
complaints.  On the day of admission, the patient was sitting on
the couch talking to his mother on the phone.  He soon became
unresponsive and lost consciousness.  His wife called EMS, and
then proceeded to perform chest compressions on the couch.  She
states that prior to him losing consciousness he did not
complain of chest pain or pressure, palpitation, shortness of
breath.  He has not had any recent fevers, chills, changes in
bladder habits, bloody stools/urine, lower or extremity edema.
EMS performed CPR, AED shocked x1.  Patient remained pulseles
after shock.  He got epi x1 and was intubated.
.
He was subsequently taken to [**Hospital3 3583**].  He was found to
be in atrial fibrillation.  He was started on amiodarone.  He
became hypotensive and was then started on neo and levo for
pressure support.  A head CT was done and was negative.  He
received at least 3L in the field.  His labs were notable bicarb
17, Cr 1.1, CPK 51, trop I 0.1, INR 2.2, dig 0.3.  He did not
receive cooling there, and was transfered by [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, his VS were: T 98.2 HR 102 BP 130/107, RR 18 100%
CMV. The patient's ECG showed atrial fibrillation with 1mm
lateral STD.  He was started on artic sun in the ED.  He was
kept on amio and levo, neo was weaned off.  He got CXR that was
consistent with pulmonary edema.  A RIJ was placed.  His VS on
transfer was: 95 125/99 vent 23/min 100%.  A bedside US probe
did not show any pericardial effusion.

[**2114-7-30**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 20%). Systolic function of apical segments is relatively
preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biventricular cavity enlargement with severe global
hypokinesis c/w diffuse process. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
.

[**2114-8-4**] CXR:
New ICD has been placed with leads terminating in expected
locations of the right atrium and right ventricle with no
evidence of pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Ground-glass and
reticular opacities have developed in the perihilar regions,
with similar appearance to an earlier radiograph of [**8-2**]. The
rapid fluctuations favor pulmonary edema over an atypical
pneumonia. There is also an area of linear atelectasis in the
right mid lung region, and there are questionable small pleural
effusions posteriorly.
.
[**2114-8-5**] EKG:
Supraventricular tachycardia. Probable atrial flutter with 2:1
block.
Since the previous tracing no significant change.


Brief Hospital Course:
47 year old man recently diagnosed with atrial flutter s/p DCCV
x2 as well as ablation, and cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology
(EF15-20%) who is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after
arresting at home and receiving AED shock for hypothermia
protocol.
.
# Post Cardiac Arrest:  Patient presented after V-fib arrest.
Hypothermia protocol was initiated on transfer.  The etiology of
his V-fib arrest was suspected to be secondary to his dilated
cardiomyopathy vs prolonged QT.  He was cooled and re-warmed.
He was initially maintained on levophed and dopamine for pressor
support, which were weaned off.  His amiodarone drip was
continued on transfer but stopped given evidence of junctional
rhythm w/ prolonged QT (see below).  EEG did not show evidence
of seizures.  Patient self-extubated himself after rewarming and
was very agitated.  He was treated with ativan.  His mental
status began returning to baseline subsequently.  An
echocardiogram was done on this admission that confirmed dilated
cardiomyopathy.  On [**10-3**], patient went into VF arrest on the
floor and was taken for urgent ICD placement with overdrive
pacing.  He was treated with 3 days of antibiotics after ICD
placement.
.
# Cardiomyopathy:  An echocardiogram done on this admission
showed biventricular cavity enlargement with severe global
hypokinesis EF 20%, and moderate MR.  Etiology of his
cardiomyopathy unknown, but suspected tachycardiac dilated CM.
Other possibilities include ETOH related, viral related.  Plan
was for patient to undergo catheterization, but he went into VF
arrest on [**10-3**] and taken for urgent ICD placement.  Cardiac
catheterization to be done as an outpatient.  TSH was checked
and was 12.  Free T3 = 92 and T4 = 8.3 which were within normal
limits.  Ace-levels were checked and also within normal limits.
Patient was started on an ace-inhibitor while in-patient.
.
# Atrial Flutter:  On admission patient was in atrial flutter.
Overnight, rhythm strips and ECG demonstrated junctional rhythm
and prolonged QT.  Amiodarone was stopped, and medications that
could prolong QTs were avoided.  Subsequent ECGs showed atrial
flutter.  Patient was started on a beta blocker.  On [**8-3**]
patient went into VF arrest and went for urgent ICD placement.
He was also started on coumadin for anticoagulation
post-procedure.
.
# Elevated TSH:  TSH 12, free T3/T4 within normal limits.
Thyroid panel will need to be repeated as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you had a cardiac
arrest.  We treated you with cooling and rewarming protocol.  We
were then able to remove you from the breathing machine.  Soon
afterwards, you had another episode of abnormal rhythm.  For
this reason we placed a defibrillator to prevent further
arrhythmias.  You will need to get this device checked soon
after discharge - please refer to the information below on
getting this appointment scheduled.
.
We made the following medication changes during this
hospitalization:
(1) You should STOP taking amiodarone.
(2) You should STOP taking digoxin.
(3) You should DECREASE lisinopril from 5 mg to 2.5 mg daily.
(4) You should INCREASE your coumadin to 5 mg daily - you will
need to get your INR checked as an outpatient to ensure that you
are taking the correct dose of this medicine.
(5) You need to take an antibiotic called cephalexin up through
[**2114-8-6**].
(6) You should INCREASE your aspirin dose to 325 mg every day.
.
It is very important that you see your primary care doctor ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 85010**]) within a few days of discharge.  He will check your
INR to make sure you are getting the right amount of coumadin.
We will provide you with a prescription to get this checked.
.
It is also really important that you schedule an appointment
with your cardiologist within the next two weeks.  He will need
to check your defibrillator to make sure that it is functioning
properly.  If your cardiologist is unable to set you up with a
defibrillator appointment, please call our device clinic soon
after discharge at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 85011**].

Followup Instructions:
(1) Please call your primary care doctor within 1 week of
discharge.  You will need a INR checked - you have a
prescription for this attached; you should get your INR checked
within 3 days of discharge.
(2) Please call your cardiologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] to be seen
within the next two weeks.  You will also need your
defibrillator checked - if Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] is unable to set this
up for you, please call our device clinic at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 85011**]
within 2 days of discharge.

Intubation

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo male nursing home resident with a history of coronary
artery disease s/p remote CABG and congestive heart failure was
admitted from his nursing home after having been found
unresponsive.
.
Patient went to go to the bathroom and started to have
""seizures."" He fell to the floor and developed loss of
consciousness with pursed lip breathing. His first vital signs
were 93% O2 sat on NRB and HR 71. Per report, his initial rhythm
was thought to be a wide complex tachycardia without evidence of
pacer spikes. He underwent temporary pacing; however, shortly
afterward, he was found to have native spikes. As temporary
pacing was discontinued, he had return of his native spikes and
regular sinus rhythm.  He was intubated and then brought to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED. Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vital signs were temp
96.5, HR 71, BP 164/90, RR 19, and pulse ox 98%. His ED course
was complicated by hypotension while on propafol.
.
Review of systems could not be obtained as patient is intubated
and sedated. Of note, in previous admissions, patient was noted
to be DNR/DNI.

Brief Hospital Course:
- ECG - [**2164-2-27**] - V paced rhythm, afib, ~75 bpm, left axis
deviation
- CT Head - [**2164-2-27**] - negative for acute intracranial process
- Portable CXR - [**2164-2-27**] - Slight lucency at the left apex most
likely represents a skin fold.  However, suggest short interval
followup. Interval improvement of aeration of the left base.
Persistent right pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, and
overhydration.
- Echocardiogram [**2164-2-27**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%). The septum is
nearly akinetic and the other basal segments moderately
hypokinetic. The apex has relatively preserved function. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with severe septal hypokinesis,
moderate hypokinesis of the basal to mid segments and relative
preservation of the apical segments. The degree of aortic
stenosis is probably severe (velocity falsely LOW due to reduced
systolic function). Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-18**],
direct comparison is difficult as both studies are suboptimal.
Overall LV systolic function is probably similar. The right
ventricle now appears dilated and hypokinetic. The degree of
aortic stenosis has increased.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1. Cardiac Arrest:
Etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear. Differential
diagnosis includes arrhythmia, pacemaker malfunction, arrest
secondary to an additional medical complication such as sepsis.
No clear localizing symptoms from prior to event and no
localizing signs on exam. EP was consulted, interrogated his
ppm, and found it to be working appropriately. He is A-sensed
and V-paced when rate drops below 70bpm. Urine and blood
cultures were sent and had no growth at time of discharge. Head
CT was negative for acute process. Relatives related that he had
had a swollen and red RLE for 2 weeks without any intervention
at rehab. LENIS were obtained and showed no DVT.

2. ? PTX
Patient's CXR had a questionable PTX after intubation. Thoracic
surgery was consulted in the ED and recommended a follow-up
chest X rays with the idea that if there was in fact development
of PTX, would consider either chest tube or pigtail catheter
placement. Further CXRs showed no evidence of PTX.

3. Respiratory Failure
Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient
does not seem to have a clear diagnosis of baseline pulmonary
disease however he did have over-hydration on the CXR. AFter TTE
showed worsened EF patient was cautiously diuresed given AS. Was
weaned off the vent after only one day and tolerated nasal
canula with sats in mid-90s.  On discharge he was 98% on RA.

4. Congestive Heart Failure
Patient had a history of CHF, although when presented initally
was euvolemic. After receiving fluids he did have increased
pulmonary congestion on a CXR and decreased O2 sats so received
some diuresis with 20mg IV lasix. He was continued on his beta
blocker and digoxin (once digoxin level came back normal). He
was re-started on a low dose of his cozaar which he had been on
previously.

5. CAD
Patient has a history of of CAD s/p CABG. No clear history of
chest pain and ECG looked relatively unchanged from prior. He
was continued on aspirin, statin, and beta blocker and
re-started the ACEI. The TTE showed new wall motion
abnormalities of RV consistent with prior ETT that showed
reversible inferior wall ischemia. In the setting of this it is
possible that he did have an acute coronary event, however, with
no clear symptoms of chest pain and no EKG changes patient was
managed conservatively with beta blockers, asa, statin, ACE as
above.

6. Depression and Dementia: He was continued on his home
citalopram, aricept, and Namenda. He required olanzipine SL at
night for ICU-delirium.

7. Hypothyroidism: He was continued on levothyroxine

8. GERD: He was continued on prilosec

9. Atrial Fibrillation
Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is s/p ppm
placement. Unclear if he has been anticoagulated in the past. As
above EP was consulted, interrogated the PPM and found AFib when
patient was not paced.

10. Lower Extremity Swelling: With RV dilation on TTE new from
prior concern for PAH from PE. LENIs were ordered and showed no
dvt. On further history son reports pt had knee surgery on that
leg. Possibly has chronic venous stasis from this.

11. Severe AS: Patient had TTE showing severe AS (valve area
0.7) worse than prior TTE dated [**2160**]. This could have been cause
of his fall as he could have syncopized. Patient was not thought
to be a surgical candidate given his multiple other medical
problems.

12. CRI: Patient had creatinines 1.3->2 in OMR. With diuresis
for respiratory status, creatinine increased to 2.2. Encouraged
PO intake. Drugs renally dosed. Avoided contrast.

intubated

History of Present Illness:
66M with PMH notable for DM2, AVRx2, tracheobronchomalacia s/p
tracheal Y stenting earlier this year presents with witnessed
PEA arrest at friend's workplace. Per family, friend reported
that patient ""appeared to be asleep."" This did not immediately
raise concern because the patient falls asleep frequently during
the day, even in social situations. His wife notes that he was
more somnolent than usual this morning; he had a hard time
getting out of bed. He went to breakfast with friends as per his
usual routine, and he actually fell asleep at the restaurant as
well. Once he slumped forward EMS was called. He was down for
approximately four minutes prior to initiation of CPR.
Apparently, his initial rhythm on EMS arrival was PEA, and he
received 1 mg epinephrine and 1 mg atropine. He also received
300 mg amiodarone but it is unclear whether this was given first
or subsequent to other medications. On tracings from EMS,
appears that patient is intermittently paced which is wide
complex and this may have been mistaken for VT. Reportedly, he
had return of pulses after 6 minutes of CPR. Two IVs were placed
and the patient was intubated in the field. Unfortunately, the
actual EMS documentation is no longer with his chart. He was
initially cooled in the field by report. [**Hospital **]hospital EKG also
concerning for inferior STEMI, but on my review, this appears
only on paced beats with ST elevations in II and III and ST
depressions in I.
.
On arrival to the ED, the patient's initial vitals were T 95.1,
HR 60 (paced), BP 80/40, O2 100%. Blood pressures decreased to
the 60s; cooling was stopped. Right femoral CVL was placed for
IV access. He was placed on dopamine gtt with persistent
hypotension and levophed was added. FAST exam was negative. He
also required epinephrine gtt to maintain blood pressures in the
90s systolic. CT head/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed
bilateral lower lobe infiltrates concerning for aspiration
versus pneumonia. He received IV ceftriaxone 1 g X 1 (but not
vancomycin which was also ordered in the ED). A left radial
arterial line as placed. On CT scan, his ETT was noted to be
anterior to his tracheal stent. IP and anesthesia/critial care
were called to the bedside where bronchoscopy was used to
reposition the tube; the ETT is now located within the stent
about 2.5 cm above the carina. Cardiology was consulted from the
ED; they did not feel that his presentation was consistent with
acute STEMI. ECHO performed at the bedside showed preserved EF
(> 55%) with no regional wall motion abnormalities.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient is not sedated but is
intubated and unresponsive to voice and painful. On further
questioning, the patient's wife notes that the patient has had a
cough productive of sputum for the past few months; he has been
treated intermittently with antibiotics for this. She reports no
recent fevers at home. The patient did not have any other
particular complaints in the past few days. As above, he was
more somnolent on the morning of this incident. Overall, the
patient's family admits that they know little about his medical
history because the patient did not share his medical problems.
The most recent medication list that the patient's wife can find
is from 9/[**2175**].

Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric LVH with probably normal LV
systolic function. Aortic valve prosthesis is not well seen but
appears to have a higher than expected velocity.

Brief Hospital Course:
66M with a past medical history notable for DM2, AVR X 2, and
TBM s/p tracheal stent who presented status post PEA arrest.
The patient was initially admitted to the medical ICU and then
transferred to the general medical floor on [**12-25**].

# PEA arrest: Circumstances surrounding the arrest are unclear.
From family history, the patient falls asleep frequently during
the day, likely secondary to chronic hypercarbia in the setting
of not using CPAP and exacerbated by patient multiple narcotic
pain medications.  It was felt likely that additional narcotics
may have  depressed his already-tenuous respiratory drive
leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia which led to PEA arrest.
Other possibilities for PEA arrest, including MI, electrolyte
abnormalities, PE, hypothermia were felt to be unlikely after
further investigation.

It is unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will
have following this event.  He was not cooled per protocol with
arctic sun due to the length of time between his arrest (~ 1315)
and arrival to the MICU (~1815) as well as the instability of
his blood pressure on arrival (he was initially on 3 pressors on
arrival to MICU). He was rapidly weaned off of the pressors.
During his admission he had continuous firing of his a/V pacer
with frequent pacer spikes on the QRS.  EP re-evaluated the
patient on [**12-23**] and shortened a sensing interval so that the
patient is now continuously V paced.  A repeat ECHO was
performed, showing an EF greater than 55 % and high transaoritc
valve pressure gradiant, largely unchanged since his echo on
presentation.  The patient also had a brief period of atrial
flutter on telemetry that resolved spontaneously during his MICU
stay.

At the time of his discharge, medications which could adversely
affect his respiratory status were discontinued or weaned down.
Specifically, his flexeril, seroquel and oxycodone were
discontinued.  His oxycontin dose was decreased to 10mg by mouth
three times daily.  He was instructed regarding the importance
of wearing his CPAP machine as instructed, and the risks of a
recurrent episode of PEA arrest should he not do so.  Given his
ongoing narcotic use, he was instructed as to the risks of
driving, and told not to drive until instructed that this was
safe by his primary care physician.

# Respiratory failure:  The primary precipitant remains unknown,
though the patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep
apnea (likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome),
tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, and
recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per wife
due to sputum production).  He also takes multiple narcotics and
other sedating medications which could contribute to altered
mental status and exacerbate hypoventilation.  On arrival, the
patient  was intubated with difficulty, complicated by the
presence of his existing tracheal stent.  Pulmonary was called
to replace the endotracheal tube under bronchoscopic guidance
because of the existing stent. The ventilator settings were
weaned and the patient was extubated on [**12-23**], sating well on 4L
NC.  Urine Legionella antigen was negative.  Sputum on [**12-20**]
grew Coag + Staph aureus and the patient was treated with
vancomycin and cefepime for and 8 day course.  Gram stain on
repeat sputum on [**12-23**] was concerning for 4+ GNRs, however, only
Staph aureus eventually grew out.  The patient's oxygen
requirement improved and he did not spike any additional fevers
while on antibiotics or after they were stopped.

The patient also received aggressive fluid resuscitation on
initial presentation.  He was diruesed with furosemide, and was
eventually placed back on his home regimen of lasix 40mg po
qdaily at the time of discharge.

# Renal insufficiency: Resolved. Baseline creatinine 0.9 to 1.1
per OSH.  Cr 2.7 on admission in setting of shock and arrest,
improved with IVF and resuscitation and returned to [**Location 213**]
range.  He was discharged home on his home regimen of lasix 40mg
po qdaiy.

# Mental status: The patient was noted to have memory deficits
(unable to remember the events surrounding his arrest as well as
both antegrade and, to a lesser extent, retrograde memory
difficulty).  He may have had an anoxic brain injury as a result
of his arrest.  The patient continued to improve during his
hospitalization, but memory remained sluggish at discharge,
thoug hpt clearly understood his surroundings, his indication
for hospitalization, treatment recommendations and instructions
for follow-up.  It was recommended that if his memory
difficulties persist that he see a behavioral neurologist as an
outpatient.  No additional neurologic deficits were noted.

# Diabetes mellitus: The patient had a FSBS in the 300s on
arrival to the ICU. He was placed on an insulin gtt and blood
sugars were monitored q1h until they were under better control.
He was eventually transitioned back to Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 **] with a
sliding scale.

# Hypertension: The patient's home antihypertensive regimen was
held on presentation given his pressor requirement.  He was
gradually started back on metoprolol, ACE, isordil and
furosemide.

# Hypercholesterolemia: pt was continued on his statin.

# Chronic pain: On presentation all of the patient's chronic
pain medications were stopped due to altered mental status.
Following transfer to the general medical floor, the patient was
restarted on oxycodone 5 mg Q6H and gradually advanced to
oxycontin 10 mg Q8H with prn oxycodone as above.  The patient
was noted to be very somnolent on this regimen which included
frequent prn oxycodone.  PRN oxycodone was stopped and the
patient gradually became more alert.  On discharge he was
advised to use a lower dose of oxycontin (10mg po tid) at home
to prevent sedation and further respiratory difficulties.
.
# CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI.
Troponin slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency
and stress from hypotension.  These enzyme elevations resolved
quickly and pt was restarted on his statin.
.
# h/o BPH - pt on ditropan and urecholine on admission.  his
urecholine was continued.  his ditropan was held [**2-8**] concerns
that anticholinergic effects could have contributed to his
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  his flomax and proscar were
continued.
.
# psych - pt continued on effexor.
.
# h/o CAD - pt continued on aspirin, metoprolol, ACE, and
statin.  he is s/p pacemaker for unclear indication per his
cardiologists note on [**2177-12-2**].  he remained v-paced in the 60s
during his hospitalization.
.
# h/o AVR x 2 - pt not on coumadin, as discussed in his last
cardiologist note [**2177-12-2**].  he had AVR [**2156**], which the patient
states is for AI. In [**2162**], his mechanical valve was switched to
a bioprosthetic valve due to poorly controlled INRs. He was on a
heparin pump at some point, but this was complicated by heparin
induced osteoporosis as well as infection.  he was clinically
euvolemic at time of discharge, and discharged home on home
regimen of lasix 40mg po qdaily.
.
# disposition - home VNA was set up, but would not be able to
start services until Friday, [**2178-1-2**] given the holiday.
Given his lack of acute medical issues (IV medication
requirement, cardiopulmonary monitoring) this was felt
reasonable.  pt was evaluated by physical therapy on and prior
to the day of discharge.  he was felt safe for discharge home
with home physical therapy.  given his impulsivity, it was
suggested that he be at home with 24 hour supervision.  pt's
wife was planning to be home on [**12-31**] and 12/25 per
conversations with family.  plan for discharge was discussed
with pt's son [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 107937**]) at 11AM.  Follow-up phone call made
at 3PM, but unable to reach, and again at 4:50PM, at which time
phone message was left.  discharge plan was also communicated by
case management and physical therapy on day of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you had stopped
breathing and your heart had stopped.  Not wearing your CPAP and
too much narcotic pain medication likely contributed to this
event by causing too much carbon dioxide to accumulate in your
blood.
.
On admission you were also found to have a pneumonia that was
treated with antibiotics.
.
To prevent a recurrence of this episode and improve your
alertness, we strongly recommend that you wear your BiPAP/CPAP
at night and that you decrease the amount of oxycontin that you
take.
.
You are having some difficulties with memory that should
continue to improve gradually over the next few weeks.  Please
see a behavioral neurologist if you are still having memory
difficulties after this time.
.
You still had a cough on discharge, likely left over from your
resolving pneumonia.  It may take a few weeks for this cough to
completely go away.  You can take an over the counter cough
syrup to help with this.  Please eat and drink sitting upright
to avoid swallowing food down your trachea.
.  Please verify your discharge list with your primary care
physician.
.
The following changes were made to you medications:
1. your oxycodone, seroquel, and ditropan were discontinued,
these can contribute to somnolence, and my have led to your
passing out.
2. your oxycontin dose was decreased to 10mg taken 3 times
daily.
3. your lasix dose was continued at 40mg once daily.
4. you were given a prescription for an albuterol inhaler.
.
You will need to arrange for 24 hour home supervision given
impulsiveness.
.
Please follow-up as directed below.
.
Please call your physician or return to the hospital if you have
fevers, worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or have other
concerning symptoms.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 28867**],[**Name11 (NameIs) 107938**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 28868**].  please arrange for an appointment
within 2 weeks of your discharge.
.
Please follow-up with your cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41196**] [**Name (STitle) **],
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 107939**].  An appointment could not be made for you, so
please call and arrange an appointment for within 3-4 weeks of
your arrival home.
.
Please follow-up with a behavioral neurologist if you continue
to have memory difficulties.  You can see one at [**Hospital1 2025**] or at [**Hospital1 18**]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1690**]).

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28265**] is a 78 yo female with extensive clot burden
?secondary to HIT (PE, aortic throbus, splenic infarct), SVT on
quinidine/metoprolol, renal stones, here s/p cardiac arrest. She
had reportedly been feeling well until the day before when she
complained of fatigue and was only able to walk 200 ft instead
of her regular 500 ft before feeling fatigued. She was noted on
[**2156-2-11**] at 4AM to be short of breath and then became
unresponsive. Her husband began CPR. EMS was called and
administered shocks and gave epinephrine. Response time is
unknown. He was intubated upon arrival to the [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**]
ED. She was found to be in SVT reportedly.

During the hospital stay, she intitially had a chest CTA which
was negative for PE. She was tachycardic and placed on an
amiodarone drip and then needed neo to support her BP. She was
initially covered broadly with vanco/zosyn/azithro without any
clear infectious source, but this was tailored to flagyl/vanco
for C. diff today. Neurology was consulted as her mental status
did not improve without sedation. They felt she opened eyes to
voice, but did not follow commands, found her PERRL, and
withdrawal to noxious stimuli. EEG was performed and showed
encephalopthay. A repeat Head CT today showed SAH so all
anticoagulation was stopped. She was placed on stress dose
steroids.

On the MICU, unable to obtain further history as patient was
intubated.

Of note, patient had recent hospital from [**1-27**] to [**2156-2-5**] where
she presented with nausea/vomiting and became hypoxic &
hypotensive in the ED, requiring pressors and intubation. She
was found to have PE and massive clot burden in body. His
suspician for HIT though negative HIT ab x 2. She has also had
ongoing AVNRT and was intiated on quinidine & lopressor per EP
recommendations.

not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened/myxomatous with suggestion
of systolic prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
are bilateral pleural effusions. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2156-1-27**], left ventricular systolic
function has deteriorated and the severity of mitral
regurgitation has increased. Mild aortic regurgitation is now
identified.

[**2156-2-14**] CT HEAD: Linear foci of high attenuation are noted in
the left frontal region (2:16, 17). These may represent small
foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Remainder of the brain is
unremarkable.

[**2156-2-15**] CT HEAD: Decreased conspicuity of focus of high
attenuation in the left frontal region which may represent an
evolving very small focus of
subarachnoid hemorrhage. 2. Prominent extra-axial frontal spaces
likely represent a subdural hygroma versus old subdural
hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 yo female with SVT, extensive clot burden (aortic,
PE, splenic infart), here s/p cardiac arrest and SAH.

1.  S/p Cardiac arrest.  Unclear precipitant of arrest.  Was
reportedly in a shockable rhythmn upon EMS arrival, so possible
torsades, ventricular arrythmia in the setting of being on
quinidine and having a prolonged qtc interval (>650) on one EKG
at OSH.  Also possibilitiy of SVT with hypotension given history
of unstable SVT.  Cardiac enzymes were not significantly
elevated at OSH so not likely to be acute MI.  Echo follow
arrest showed EF fell to 20-25 from 45% two weeks ago. She was
continued on amiodarone and then had successful ablation of
AVNRT on [**2156-2-16**] with subsequent sinus rhythm. Amiodarone was
subsequently discontinued.

2.  SVT.  Patient has narrow complex tachycardia consistent with
AVNRT.  Started on amiodarone and neo, but had been discharged 2
weeks ago with quinidine and metoprolol.  Reportly normotensive
when in sinus rhythm.  Echo shows reduced EF from prior echo
from 3 weeks ago concerning for ischemia versus tachycardia
induced cardiomyopathy. Quindine was discontinued and amiodarone
was started. Underwent successful ablation of SVT with patient
remaining in normal sinus rhythm for remainder of admission.
Amidodarone discontinued after ablation. Metoprolol IV 5mg q6
was changed to metoprolol 25mg PO BID for improved rate control.

3. Altered mental status. Very poor on admission but improved
prior to discharge.  AMS likely multifactorial due to anoxic
brain injury, new findings of SAH, toxic-metabolic in setting of
C. diff infection, and baseline generalized atrophy. Repeat head
CT showed stable SAH. She was treated for C. diff. Once patient
was extubated, she was able to communicate and was AAOx3 but did
have some hoarseness thought secondary to ET tube. She was able
to follow commands and move all 4 extremities upon discharge.

4.  Hypotension.  Per OSH, when in sinus rhythm not hypotensive,
so hypotension is likely secondary to tachycardia.  Also likely
an element of hypovolemia in setting of lasix diuresis at OSH
and ongoing C. diff.  Given clot burden, concern for recurrent
PE, though CTA of chest reportedly negative from OSH and was
therapeutic on coumadin on arrival to OSH. In the MICU was
quickly weaned off pressors and with ablation her blood pressure
has been stable and tolerating addition of her beta blocker.

5.  Extensive clot burden.  Patient has extensive clot burden
likely presumed originally thought [**12-29**] HIT but HITnegative x 2.
Found to have large PE, splenic infarcts, large aortic thrombus.
 No history of malignancy but could pursue malignancy workup as
outpatient. SRA checked and negtaive. Heme consult said this was
not HIT and transitioned her from argatroban to lovenox with
bridge to coumadin. Her coumadin dose will need to be adjusted
based on goal INR of [**12-30**]. Her platelets remained stable at time
of discharge on lovenox and coumadin. She will follow up with
heme-onc as outpatient.

6.  C. diff.  Found to have C. diff positive stool at OSH with
ongoing diarrhea which improved throughout course. She was
initially  treated with Vanco and PLagyl then transitioned to PO
vanco for 2 week course (starting [**2-11**]).

7.  Hyponatremia.  Likely hypovolemic in setting of C. diff and
diuresis at OSH. Improved with hydration.

8.FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet. Passed video
swallow but will need calorie count. Able to have regular diet
with thin liquids and ensure supplements.

9.Prophylaxis: lovenox bridge to coumadin, pneumoboots

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after you had a cardiac arrest which we
believe was because of the medication quinidine you were on. You
were intubated in the setting of the arrest but extubated with
the complication of some vocal cord trauma which should continue
to improve. In addition, we found a small bleed in your head
that we believe is secondary to your anticoagulation with
coumadin.  You had a fast heart rate and underwent a procedure
to fix it and have been in normal sinus rhythm since. You were
also found to have an infection called Clostridium difficile
that can cause diarrhea. You are now on antibiotic called
vancomycin to treat this infection.
.
We changed some of your medications:
STOP: quinidine
Change: metoprolol from 50mg by mouth twice a day to 25mg by
mouth twice a day
Change: coumadin from 3mg to 2mg by mouth daily
New: Vancomycin to be completed on [**2156-3-3**].

1. No acute intra-abdominal pathology.
2. Persistent right basilar hydropneumothorax (with chest tube)
with decreased atelectasis or consolidation adjacent to it.
3. Unchanged small left effusion with atelectasis.
4. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
5. Overall decrease in abdominal ascites with persistent
anasarca of the soft tissues.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 M admitted s/p PEA arrest, h/o prior arrest with anoxic brain
injury, trach/PEG for resp failure, bronchopleural fistula with
chest tube, CHF with EF 15%, CVA with seizure disorder, s/p
treatment for MRSA, ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia, and VRE UTI.

1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt likely suffered PEA arrest due to
hypoxic resp failure secondary to ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia.  On
admission to MICU, pt was intubated and placed on PSV.  He was
treated with vancomycin/meropenem for h/o MRSA and ESBL
klebsiella identified on sputum cx, and switched to
linezolid/meropenem for new onset VRE from urine cx.  He
remained hemodynamically stable in the ICU, and PSV was
progressively weaned over several days.  On [**2141-5-31**], he
successfully underwent a spontaneous breathing trial, and was
switched to a trach mask.  His chest tube demonstrated
persistent air leaks likely from his bronchopleural fistula.  It
was placed on a clamp trial on [**2141-5-31**], but pt showed increased
work on breathing and became tachycardic within 30min.  The
chest tube was unclamped and left on water seal for the
remainder of his MICU course, which the patient tolerated well.


Of note the [**5-31**] pleural fluids had rare gram negative rods, his
chest tube is draining to a 'pneumostat seal', interventional
pulmonary was notified and will follow him to manage the chest
tube.   Chest x-rays should be repeated every few days to see if
the broncopleural fistula has healed, and that point
consideration will be given toward discontinuing the chest tube;
in the interval; linezolid and meropenem should be continued for
a total of 6 weeks.
.
2) FEVER/LEUKOCYTOSIS: On [**2141-5-27**], pt became febrile up to 102,
with WBC to 12, and was hypotensive to SBP 90s.  His BP
responded quickly to fluids, not requiring pressors.  Sputum cx
demonstrated ESBL Klebsiella and urine cx showed VRE.  He was
switched from vancomycin/meropenem to linezolid/meropenem for
treatment of his pneumonia and UTI.  His R femoral line was also
removed for concerns of a line infxn, though blood and cath tip
cultures remained negative at time of discharge.  Both his
leukocytosis and fever resolved within 24hrs, and he remained
afebrile for the duration of his hospital course.
.
3) ANEMIA: At initial presentation, pt's hct trended down
slowly, requiring transfusions with 3u pRBCs over 3 days.  Small
amounts of blood was initially noted draining from his chest
tube and PEG tube, and stool was guaiac+.  CT abdomen and pelvis
revealed no intraabdominal pathology.  Later, frank bleeding was
noted from the underside of his tongue, likely a laceration
secondary to tongue biting.  ENT was consulted and the site was
cauterized with silver nitrate and packed with gauze with good
effect.  Pt's hct stabilized after cauterization.  Aspirin and
heparin SC were held but restarted on discharge.
.
4) CHF ischemic with systolic dysfunction (EF 15%): Given his
hypotensive episode on [**2141-5-27**], his home blood pressure
medications were held.  Lasix was periodically given for gentle
diuresis.  Diuretics remain held given that his creatinine would
rise with attempts at diuresis.
He came in on 100 IV lasix with 100 IV chlorthalidone TID, he
may need to restart this should he oxygenation deteriorate.  The
pt has anasarca.  Diuresis will need to be restarted with
caution with his low nl blood pressure and known infections.
-aspirin restared on discharge, consider restarting metoprolol
12.5 TID if blood pressure tolerates.  Goal SBP in 90-100 range.
.
5) CRI: Pt's creatinine was near baseline for most of his MICU
stay.  It did tend Medications were renally dosed as necessary.
.
6) F/E/N: Pt was maintained on tube feeds with protein supp
.
7) PPx: IV PPIs, pneumoboots, hep SCbowel regimen
.
8) Access: L arm PICC placed on [**6-4**]
.
9) Code: Despite h/o anoxic brain injury and pt in a persistent
vegetative state, pt remains full code per family discussions.
.
Disposition: The patient is returned to his long term
rehabilitation facility.

Cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
AICD placement


History of Present Illness:
40 yo M with h/o syncope with exercise, cardiomyopathy (echo in
[**6-2**] with EF 45%, mild LV hk, moderatley dilated LV, mildly
dilated LA, RA) who presented to OSH after cardiac arrest with
AED shocks x2. He was at work at a mental [**Location (un) **] hospital,
playing [**Doctor First Name 13792**] [**Doctor Last Name 13793**] with a patient, when per report he grabbed his
chest, screamed and fell to ground. AED was applied and shocked
twice. The pt was brought to [**Hospital **] hosp. Pt does not remember
events, first thing he remembers is at [**Hospital1 **] ER. He has a h/o
syncope with report of h/o VT in [**2127**] requiring ICD placement.
The ICD was removed in [**2128**] for an MRI that needed to be done to
assess his cervical spine. While the ICD was in place pt reports
one episode of multiple shocks while playing basketball. He
notes fluttering of chest and lightheadedness when he bends down
and gets up, and when he lifts leg weights. He is on atenolol
and vasotec but misses doses frequently and has not been to his
doctor in about 2 years. He had been feeling normal up until the
episode. He does remember feeling anything strange prior to
episode. His son reports he was slightly lethargic and confused
in [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. He denied chest pain, palpitations, SOB, N/V, abd
pain upon transfer. He does note PND but denies orthopnea. He
states he wakes up SOB and needs to sit up and breathe
frequently to catch his breath. He does snore and had a sleep
study but does not know results. He was started on lidocaine gtt
at [**Hospital1 **] and given ativan for anxiety and given potassium and
magnesium.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old male
patient with a history of kidney/pancreas transplant and
diabetes mellitus type 2 times 30 years who was admitted for
ventricular fibrillation arrest in the setting of acidosis
and hyperkalemia.  The patient's bicarbonate was 6 and
potassium was 7.3.  Patient had apparently not felt well, had
nausea and vomiting over the course of seven days prior to
admission.  The patient's cardiac arrest code lasted about 30
minutes.  The patient was defibrillated six times and
subsequently intubated.  A sinus rhythm was able to be
re-obtained.  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient received intravenous
calcium, Kayexalate, insulin, glucose, and after correction
of his hyperkalemia, actually began some hypokalemic
requiring some repletion.  The etiology of his acidemia
remains unclear and cannot be attributed to a hyperkalemic
state.  After the admission, the Renal Service placed a left
IJ Quinton catheter and the patient was dialyzed.  Creatinine
urine output has been improving since the dialysis.  The
patient also received a bicarbonate infusion, and patient's
serum bicarbonate repleted over 24 hours.

As an outpatient, he has diffuse coronary artery disease on a
cardiac catheterization in [**2101**] consistent with 100% proximal
right coronary artery occlusion in a right dominant system
with elevated mean wedge pressure at 34.  No interventions
were performed at that time.  The patient has been evaluated
by Cardiology in the past and it is unclear whether patient's
arrest is really related to coronary artery disease.  The
rhythm strips were unable to be obtained.  The arrest is most
likely secondary to from hyperkalemia, acidemia, however,
there is old scar from a prior myocardial infarction and it
is felt that the patient will likely need an outpatient
Electrophysiology Consult to evaluate for a scar origination
of his ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation
arrest.  Patient was extubated on hospital day number two
without any complications.  No further events.  Patient was
called out to the regular floor on [**2105-5-16**].  Patient
continued to improve under the watch of the Renal Service as
well as the primary medical team.  Given his old three vessel
disease, it was felt that the patient should undergo a repeat
cardiac catheterization to determine whether he would be a
candidate for revascularization given his diabetes, low
ejection fraction.

Patient went for a cardiac catheterization on [**2105-5-21**].
The cardiac catheterization showed diffuse disease in three
vessels.  Patient had 80% after D1, 80% after D3, 70% more
distally in the left anterior descending as well, with a 50%
proximal in the large D1.  The patient had 80% proximal OM1,
and a totally occluded right coronary artery with mild left
anterior descending collateralization.  No interventions were
performed, and patient was referred to CT surgery for a
coronary artery bypass graft.

Of note, after patient's cardiac catheterization, patient's
right foot was noted to be cold and pulseless.  A Vascular
Consult was obtained emergently.  It was thought that
patient's symptoms were consistent with a distal embolus from
his cardiac catheterization procedure.  Patient was taken to
the Operating Room on the evening of [**2105-5-21**] around
midnight, and patient underwent a thrombectomy of his right
lower extremity femoropopliteal bypass graft.  Surgery went
without any complications.

Patient was transferred back to Medicine on [**5-24**] for
further work-up of his coronary disease.  An ultrasound was
obtained of his lower extremities, as well as his upper
extremities to evaluate for proper conduits for a coronary
artery bypass graft.  Patient had no SAGs given his bilateral
femoropopliteal, patient's small left subclavian had diffuse
disease, and bilateral radial arteries had diffuse disease
and calcifications.  It was felt that patient did not have
adequate conduits for any bypass grafts, and after further
discussion, patient was referred back to Interventional
Cardiology for possible high risk percutaneous interventions.

Patient was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who felt that the
patient would be extremely high risk for a percutaneous
intervention and would most likely benefit from a left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending bypass
graft.  This was brought up with his Cardiothoracic surgeon,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**], who agreed and thought that the patient could
be discharged and followed up as an outpatient. Prior to
discharge, the patient underwent a MRA of his chest to
evaluate for the quality of the left internal mammary artery
which would be used as a graft in his one vessel bypass.  The
results of this MRA are pending.

Patient had no episodes of chest pain while in the hospital
and patient's potassium and creatinine had been stable.
Patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in one week and Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 805**] in one week as well and further additions will be
made regarding his revascularization procedure.   Post
revascularization, patient will need an EP Consult to
determine whether he would benefit from an EP study given his
episode of ventricular fibrillation arrest.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year-old Male with a PMH significant non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy (cardiac MRI showing dilated LV with
mild-to-moderate global systolic dysfunction, EF 42%, mild MR in
[**2165**]), HLD, known LBBB who was in bed this morning at 7:45 AM
and his wife noted him to be unresponsive with agonal breathing.
She moved him to the floor and started CPR. His son (a
firefighter-paramedic in-training) was notified and arrived to
assist with CPR. Of note, the patient flew to [**State 8842**] for
vacation on Tuesday last week and returned urgently given the
news that his brother had expired from [**Name (NI) **] at age 55 years-old.
He returned from [**State 8842**] Sunday evening. EMS arrived and an AED
was placed; three shocks were fired for ventricular fibrillation
(torsades de Pointes appearance) on the rhythm strip, and CPR
was resumed. There was ROSC and he had some spontaneous
movements, but he remained unresponsive on arrival to the
[**Hospital3 78558**] ED. The evening prior to his AM
arrest, he was without any complaints and fell asleep
comfortably.
.
In the [**Hospital3 **] ED, initial VS 97.6 149/106 89 14 100%
intubated. He was intubated (had spontaneous respirations,
dilated pupils, rechecked at 3-4 mm) and sedated with a Propofol
gtt. EKG showed sinus rhythm with known LBBB. Portable CXR noted
some pulmonary congestion. Laboratory studies showed a WBC 8.3,
HCT 42.9%, PLT 211. Potassium 3.8 and creatinine 1.0. INR 1.0.
Troponin-T < 0.01. pro-BNP 80.9. A urinalysis was negative.
Hypothermia protocol was initiated and he was given 2L chilled
normal saline and reached a core temperature of 32.6 degrees
Celsius. Propofol gtt was continued. A Dopamine gtt was started
given some SBP in the 70-80 mmHg range. He was given Fentanyl
250 mg IV x 1 and Rocuronium 50 mg IV x 1. He was also given
Amiodarone 300 mg IV x 1. [**Location (un) 86**] [**Location (un) 7622**] transported the
patient to [**Hospital1 18**] at 9:05 AM. Prior to in-flight arrival, he
received an additional 200 mg of IV Fentanyl, Midazolam 2 mg IV
and Rocuronium 60 mg IV x 1. His rhythm strip demonstrated sinus
tachycardia to the 110s with left-bundle morphology noted.
.
Of note, the patient was found to have a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 30% by echocardiogram in [**12/2163**] that was
performed after an EKG was noted to be abnormal. A repeat
2D-Echo in [**2165-3-30**] revealed a LVEF of 20% with global
hypokinesis. Cardiac catheterization was performed in [**5-/2165**]
revealing normal coronary arteries and low normal right and left
sided filling pressures. A cardiac MRI was performed [**7-/2165**],
showing an effective forward LVEF of 39% without evidence of
scarring or infarction. The right
ventricular ejection fraction was normal. Given these findings,
he was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Electrophysiology clinic, and he
recommended repeating a 2D-Echo, which was done in [**8-/2167**] and
showed an LVEF of 40-45% and thus ICD placement was deferred at
that time.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient arrived on cooling protocol
and was minimally responsive given sedation and paralyzation.
His rhythm was sinus tachycardia to the 110s with a left
bundle-branch morphology. Initial VS, 91.9 112 137/54 19 100%
(CMV/assist 500/14/5/100%). ABG 7.27/48/177.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
.
ROS: The patient denies a history of prior stroke/TIA, deep
venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. They deny bleeding at
the time of prior procedures or surgeries. Denies headaches or
vision changes. No cough or upper respiratory symptoms. Denies
chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations.

New left subclavian right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead
has a standard course. There is no pneumothorax, pleural
effusion, or mediastinal widening.  Heart size is normal and the
lungs are grossly clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
IMPRESSION: 59M with a PMH significant for non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy (cardiac MRI showing dilated LV with
mild-to-moderate global systolic dysfunction, EF 42%, mild MR in
[**2165**]), HLD, known LBBB who is status-post sudden cardiac arrest
(with undetermined rhythm) who had ROSC after shocks and CPR who
is now intubated, sedated, paralyzed and on a hypothermia
protocol, and is now hemodynamically stable.
.
# STATUS-POST SUDDEN CARDIAC (VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION) ARREST -
The patient presented with a witnessed sudden cardiac arrest
event the morning of admission - rhythm strip consistent with
ventricular fibrillation (torsades de Pointes appearance). He
has no known coronary disease given his clean coronaries (per
report) on cardiac catheterization in [**2165**]. The patient has a
strong family history of [**Year (4 digits) **]/SCD (maternal aunt and recently his
55 year-old brother). Patient's time from arrest to CPR was
presumably brief and he had ROSC with 3-shocks on EMS arrival
(rhythm undetermined). A hypothermia protocol was initiated and
the patient was transported via [**Last Name (un) **]-flight to [**Hospital1 18**]. Etiologies
for sudden cardiac arrest included ACS versus arrhythmia,
enzymes flat and EKG with LBBB but not meeting criteria for ACS.
 Likely this was arrhythmia related from some congenital defect,
as he has a strong family history of SCD. The Artic Sun cooling
protocol continued for 18-hours and then the patient was
rewarmed without issues. We started empiric heparinization of
the patient given his ACS/MI and empiric concerns for pulmonary
emboli. We also started Aspirin, Atorvastatin and Metoprolol
given the concern for acute coronary syndrome; but ultimately
his cardiac biomarkers were reassuring and he had no new wall
motion abnormalities on 2D-Echo so atorvastatin was discontinued
and his aspirin was lowered to 81mg. He received an Amiodarone
load of 300 mg IV at the outside hospital, but this was not
continued on arrival to the CCU. His CTA chest was negative for
pulmonary embolus and his heparin gtt was discontinued. A
48-hour EEG was continued per post-arrest protocol and showed no
evidence of epileptiform foci, only moderate global
encephalopathy. A 2D-Echo showed no evidence of focal wall
motion abnormality and his LVEF was stable as compared to prior.
Following his rewarming protocol, sedation was weaned off, he
awoke and was extubated on [**2169-1-25**] without issues. He had no
focal neurologic deficits. He required cardiac MR imaging on
[**1-26**] that showed no change from his previous cardiac MR, with
EF 45%, no late gadolinium enhancement and a small anteroseptal
wall motion abnormality that wasn't specific to one particular
coronary distribution and was likely the result of the arrest.
An ICD was placed on [**1-27**].  He will have to follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-23**] for an EP study and cardiac cath on [**2-24**] to
further identify any etiology for his vfib arrest.
.
# NON-ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY - The patient had a 2D-Echo which
showed an LVEF of 30% by 2D-Echo in [**12/2163**] that was performed
after an office EKG was noted to be abnormal (Q-waves in the
inferior leads). A repeat 2D-Echo in [**5-/2165**] revealed a LVEF of
20% with global hypokinesis. Cardiac catheterization was
performed in [**5-/2165**] revealing normal coronary arteries and low
normal right and left sided filling pressures. A cardiac MRI was
performed [**7-/2165**], showing an effective forward LVEF of 39%
without evidence of scarring or infarction. The right
ventricular ejection fraction was normal. He was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in Electrophysiology clinic, and he recommended
repeating a 2D-Echo, which was done in [**8-/2167**] and this showed an
LVEF of 40-45% and thus ICD placement was deferred at that time.
He has been managed as an outpatient with ACEI and beta-blocker.
This admission, his repeat 2D-Echo following his cardiac arrest
showed an LVEF of 45%, with similar findings compared to his
prior study. We restarted his home Lisinopril without issue. We
started Metoprolol and titrated this to control his heart rate;
we discontinued his home Carvedilol dose.
.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - The patient had no prior hyperlipidemia
history, but a strong family history of coronary disease. He had
no statin [**Doctor Last Name 360**] on-board prior to this admission. We started
Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily given concern ACS/MI. His lipid
panel was overall reassuring and ultimately atorvastatin was
discontinued as it was felt that his arrest was likely related
to arrhythmia rather than ACS/atherosclerosis.
.

Cardiac History:
The patient initially presented with syncope at age of l2. At
l3, the patient was seen at [**Hospital3 1810**] for history of
syncope, chest pain and progressive exercise intolerance. She
was found to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. She was
subsequently cathed. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure was
found to be 20. She was then started on chronic Verapamil
therapy. At age l6, she experienced cardiac arrest secondary to
complex tachycardia. She was successfully resuscitated. Repeat
catheterization showed left ventricular end diastolic pressure
of 36-40 without outflow tract obstruction. EP showed inducible
atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular blood pressure. She was
felt to have a rapid antegrade conduction and possible
pre-excitation. She was started on Norpace. Since then, the
patient has been stable on Verapamil and Norpace with occasional
palpitations, chest pain and light headedness.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -77 BY DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN
[**Name Initial (PRE) **]: In comparison with study of [**5-19**], the right chest tube
has been removed. No evidence of pneumothorax.
Otherwise, little overall change. The right-sided parenchymal
opacification persists, as does the retrocardiac opacification
consistent with atelectasis and effusion. The other tubes remain
in place.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2121-5-19**] 8:10 AM
As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and
support devices are in unchanged position. Unchanged position of
the right-sided chest tube, the side port of the chest tube is
still in the thoracic wall and slightly outside the lung. The
right-sided parenchymal opacity is further resolving. Subtle
increase of the retrocardiac atelectasis. Otherwise, no
newly-appeared parenchymal opacities. No evidence of pleural
effusions.

The left and right atria are moderately dilated. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no valvular [**Male First Name (un) **] or resting LVOT gradient. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is high normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-5-1**], the
magnitude of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure have decreased.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2120**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-19**]  8:57:12 AM
Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is 120 milliseconds. Left axis
deviation.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Diffuse
non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
there is no significant change.
TRACING #7
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2121-5-20**] 2:06 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier films of this date, there
has been placement of a right subclavian PICC line with its tip
in the upper portion of the SVC. The opacification at the right
base is slightly less prominent and there has been a better
inspiration.
The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have been removed.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-20**]  11:22:44 AM
Sinus rhythm. Peaked P waves consistent with right atrial
enlargement. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2121-5-19**] right bundle-branch block has appeared.
Clinical correlation is suggested
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2121-5-21**] 11:19 AM
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart remains enlarged,
and there are new, ill-defined airspace opacities at both bases,
most likely due to edema given the rapid time appearance.
Pulmonary vasculature remains slightly engorged. A focus of
linear opacity in the left lung base is likely atelectasis. The
upper lung zones remain relatively well aerated with no focal
consolidation or pneumothorax.
A right PICC terminates at the origin of the SVC.
IMPRESSION: Interval increase in pulmonary edema, with
persistent cardiomegaly and fluid overload.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-22**]  4:45:32 AM
Coarse atrial fibrillation. Minimal left axis deviation with
right
bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-5-20**]
atrial
fibrillation has replaced normal sinus rhythm. Coarse atrial
fibrillation is stated by some to be more frequent with valvular
heart disease than coronary heart disease.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-23**]  3:17:28 AM
Coarse atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Left axis
deviation with probable left anterior fascicular block. Probable
right

Brief Hospital Course:
34 yo woman with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, multifocal atrial
tachycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, h/o AVNRT, with
multiple previous cardiac arrests with PEA arrest, likely [**3-15**]
hyperkalemia.
.
# s/p PEA arrest: Etiologies include hyperkalemia, vs. other
acidosis which precipated hyperkalemia. Unsure of what
precipitated hyperkalemia. patient was receiving KDur
supplements at [**Hospital1 **], however this still should not have been
enough to cause her degree of hyperkalemia. patient has been
hypokalemic since admission, and has required K supplements.
During resuscitation patient had two lines placed which were
non-sterile.  She was therefore given prophylactic vancomycin
and aztreonam until the lines could be removed. The lines were
removed after two days, once her INR was reversed with IV
vitamin K. She did not develop any ekg findings suggestive of
hyperkalemia throughout her hospitalization.  She did not
develop any further episodes of ventricular tachycardia
throughout her hospitalization.  She will need follow up of her
electrolytes as per discharge orders.
.
# Fluid Status: Patient was total body fluid overloaded
throughout her hospitalization, requiring IV lasix to improve
urine output. She was eventually transitioned to her home dose
of lasix 80mg PO daily. Her lasix dosing was increased to 80mg
PO BID on [**5-26**], as she still had an oxygen requirement and was
still reporting edematous extremities.
.
# Rhythm. History of multiple atrial tachyarrhythmias s/p recent
failed ablation. Anticoagulated w/ coumadin as outpatient given
frequent AT with RVR. the patient developed atrial flutter on
[**5-21**]. This was treated with amiodarone, verapamil and increased
doses of metoprolol. An ablation was considered to be
unnecessary at this time given her history of complications with
procedures.  Her coumadin was restarted, and eventually
increased to 4mg PO daily, which is double her home dose, to be
titrated according to INR goal [**3-16**].  She should have her INR
drawn according to discharge orders, on [**2121-5-29**].
.
# Respiratory status: She was extubated on [**5-20**], and was weaned
to 96% O2 saturation on 4L.  CXR showing possible RLL opacity
vs. fluid overload. Her montelukast and atrovent was continued.

.
# Fever: Unclear etiology. had persistent leukocytosis at
previous admission, s/p 10 day course with aztreonam and clinda,
finished on [**2121-5-19**].  Spiked temp to 101.9 [**5-20**].  However, her
leukocytosis persisted during this admission. She was pan
cultured and cultures have been negative.  She was not started
on another regimen of antibiotics during this admission after
completing her previous 10 day course.
.
# Weakness: PT evaluated Ms. [**Known lastname **] and recommended rehab
placement.  However, she refused.  She also refused to attempt
climbing [**Last Name (LF) 5927**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] her ability to do so was not able to be
evaluated.  She was sent home in an ambulance and with help to
get into her house.
.
# Anxiety: sertraline, bupropion, clonazepam were continued.
.
# FEN: Patient required thin liquid diet.

[**5-24**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 25% to 30% (nl >=55%)
The left atrium is normal in size. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include anteroseptal and anterior akinesis with
hypokinesis elsewhere (the apex is not well visualized). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal; free wall motion may be
mildly to moderately depressed but is not fully visualized. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**5-25**] C. CATH:
COMMENTS:
  1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant
system
without flow limiting disease angiographically. The LMCA was
without
disease angiographically. The LAD wrapped around the apex and
was
without flow limiting stenoses. The LCX was filling a large OM1
and Om2
and was without flow limiting stenoses. The RCA was the dominant
vessel
without flow limiting stenoses.
  2. Left ventriculography showed severe hypokinesis of the
anterolateral and apical walls. The calculated contrast ejection

fraction was 36%. There was no mitral regurgitation
angiographically.
  3. Limited resting hemodynamics showed a borderline pulmonary
artery
pressure (PA mean 21 mmHg). The left and right sided filling
pressures
were minimally elevated (LVEDP 16 mmHg, RVEDP 14 mmHg). The
cardiac
output was normal (CO 6.1 l/min, CI 2.4 l/min/m2). There was no
gradient
across the aortic valve.
.
[**5-27**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60-70%). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2128-5-24**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is markedly
increased.
.
[**5-27**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. First degree atrio-ventricular conduction delay.
Compared to the previous tracing no major change
.
[**5-28**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. First degree atrio-ventricular conduction delay.
Diffuse
non-diagnostic T wave flattening. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2128-5-27**] no major change.
.
[**5-28**] PA &LAT CXR Post ICD:
Tip of the right atrial transvenous pacer lead projects over the
superior cavoatrial junction, not directed anteriorly toward the
right auricle, which is usually seen. Transvenous right
ventricular pacer defibrillator lead is in standard placement,
tip directed towards the anterior right ventricular apex.
Lungs clear. No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or mediastinal
widening.
.
[**5-29**] CXR post lead revision:
Comparison made with the prior chest from [**Month (only) 116**] the 19. The
position of the two ICD wires remains unchanged and
satisfactory. The satisfactory position is confirmed on the
lateral film. No failure or infiltrates are present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression:
46 yo M with obesity, smoker, remote h/o cocaine use, presents
s/p rescucitated cardiac arrest secondary to polymorphic VT.
1. Cardiac arrest: polymorphic VT: likely seciondary to ischemia
of the LAD territory based on ECG and bedside echo. D/c amio
gtt, started lidocaine gtt. Pt was loaded with 300mg Plavix
prior to going to C. Cath the following morning from admission.
Cath found clean coronaries. Pt was not contnued on ASA, high
dose statin due to clean coronaries but started on a BB. Pt
continued to have ectopy on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ICD was placed per EP on
[**5-27**]. Leads misplaced and repositioned on [**5-28**], pacer also
firing dysynchronously with a 12beat run of NSVT on [**5-28**]. On
[**5-31**] ICD was tested per EP without complications. CE were cycled
with elevated CK most likely [**2-12**] CPR as Tn-T remained
unremarkable. EKGs also without any evidence of ischemia, no
NSTEMI during his admission. His ASA and statin were d/c'd as
coronaries were clean. He was continued on BB and ACE-I for
better BP and HR control. Pt was to f/u in device clinic within
1 week.
.
2. Resp failure: intub in the field for airway protection. Also
likley LLL infiltrate on CXR. Pt was successfully extubated the
following day without incident. His O2 sats remained well above
95% on RA. He was started on Clinda for presumed aspiration PNA
given prolonged rescusitation in the field. He completed a 7 day
course of clinda.
.
3. Neuro: moved all extremities spontaneously. Full neuro exam
after off sedation/extubated was normal. There was a question of
possible frontol lobe involvement [**2-12**] probable hypoxia given his
inappropriate comments and behavior. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] followed the
pt's course since admission and did not feel his behavior was
due to a hypoxic/anoxic insult or due to frontal lobe
involvement. Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt behavior was c/w grandiose
personality and character traits rather than a neurological
deficit. However, given issues of non-compliance and pt's
reluctance to comply with medical advice a psych consult was
obtained to further evaluate pt's competency. Per psych, they
called [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 67070**] which agreed that his behavior was at his
baseline. Per psych pt was competent and did not see a reason to
section him. Pt was stable for d/c back to half way house.

History of Present Illness:
64 yo female with history of COPD/ respiratory failure s/p
trach, ruptured diverticula s/p surgical repair [**1-20**] who is
normally followed at [**Hospital1 2177**] who was found at [**Hospital3 672**] today
looking cyanotic in asystole.  She was given epi and atropine
down her trach leading to a perfusing rhythm.  En route she
began flexor/ extensor posturing which continued upon arrival in
the ED as well as constant upward gaze.
.
Neurology evaluated the patient in the ED and found bilateral
flexor posturing of the arms and bilateral extensor posturing in
addition to lack of brainstem reflexes.  Their impression was
likely anoxic brain injury, however versed had been administered
and pupillary reactions could be paralyzed by the atroping given
during the arrest.
.
In the ED, saturations were in the high 90's on the vent, with
HR to the 150's and SBP to 230's.  Diltiazem IV (not gtt) was
given for HR with good control in the ED.  Given
vanco/levo/flagyl for possible infection given elevated WBC to
52.0.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Asystolic arrest: most likely [**3-19**] hypoxia from PTX in the
setting of infection and small subsegmental PE.
.
#PTX- Evident on CT and pt w/elevated peak pressures despite
trache.
- Thoracic surgery consulted for chest tube placement. placed
chest tube in right chest in ICU [**2128-3-19**]. removed CT on [**2128-3-22**].
repeat CXR shows no PTX on right. transitioned to previous vent
settings and doing well/ stabilized.
.
#Small subsegmental PE and anticoagulation: She was started on
heparin on HD 1, and then transitioned to coumadin and lovenox.
At this same time, she experienced a HCT drop from 25 to 19 in
the setting of receiving 2L of NS.  She was guiaic negative at
the time, however her CXR showed a new left sided pleural
effusion.  A CT of her chest did not show a large hemothorax and
her LE dopplers were negative for clot.  With these in mind, she
was restarted on coumadin and lovenox and her hematocrit
remained stable over the day.
.
#elevated WBC- probable VAP w as well as UTI (U/A positive
however Urine culture negative); CT abdomen (-) [**2128-3-20**] for acute
intraabdominal pathology. Sputum culture grew acinetobacter
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 36**] to Gentamicin and MSSA.  However since the
patient is MRSA + in her nares, we will continue Vancomycin and
Gentamicin for 5 more days post discharge.
- c diff negative x 3
.
# abdominal pain and obstipation- recent colectomy for ruptured
diverticulae, w/o output from end colostomy since admission-
concerning for torsion of bowel. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis
[**2128-3-20**] showed no acute intraabdominal pathology. However, it did
show distended stomach- g tube placed on gravity per thoracics
recs without improvement in sx.
- surgery consulted: recommend bowel regimen with colace,
mineral oil;
- TF restarted without problem
- aggressive bowel regimen
- guiaic negative stool in colostomy
.
#Poor mental status- improved over hospitalization- thought at
first to be anoxic brain injury. head CT negative for acute
bleed. neuro exam on arrival to ICU was withdrawing to painful
stimuli and minimal corneal and gag reflexes.
per neuro recs- no need for LP at this time
- EEG showed slow and disorganized background, as well as the
bursts of generalized delta slowing; mild-moderate
encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections, toxic
metabolic abnormalities, medication effect or ischemia

ADDENDUM:  There is one correction from initial discharge
summary under hospital course.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent thrombectomy with
directed TPA, which is tissue plasminogen activator not total
parenteral alimentation.

From an pulmonary standpoint the patient remained off the
ventilator and on a 40% tracheostomy mask for greater periods
of time throughout the day.  He was off the ventilator for a
total of 48 hours and on the trach mask at which time he then
fatigued and required resting on minimal amounts of pressure
support and at this time is able to tolerate tracheostomy
mask for over twelve hours per day.  He had a Passy Muir
valve placed and tolerates it well.  His cough has improved.
He is able to clear his own secretions requires less
suctioning.

From an infectious disease standpoint, the patient is to
complete his course of Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia on
[**2166-11-19**].  At this time he remains afebrile, although his
white count has been slowly rising, all remaining cultures
have been no growth to date and he will need to be monitored
after discharge for any evidence of persistent infection
after his antibiotics are completed.  Blood cultures were
sent on [**12-19**] from his right sided PICC line as well as C-diff
stool cultures sent on [**12-18**], which is pending at this time.

Hematology, the patient received one additional unit of
packed red blood cells on [**11-17**] for a hematocrit of 23.
There has been no evidence of active bleeding.  His stools
have been guaiac negative.  This was felt secondary to
frequent phlebotomy.  His hematocrit bumped to 28
appropriately and has remained stable.

Nutrition, the patient remained on tube feeds at his goal
rate of 60 cc per hour.  He is having normal bowel movements
and remains on Prevacid for a history of upper
gastrointestinal bleed, which is stable.

Cardiovascular, the patient was restarted on Lopresor as well
as Lipitor for his history of hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia.  He was not restarted on Amiodarone
given the potential lung toxicity.

Psychiatric, over the past several days the patient had
episodes of increased confusion and agitation.  His
benzodiazepines and opiates were discontinued and the patient
was started on Zyprexa, which will be increased to 5 mg po
q.h.s., which has improved his overall mental status.  On the
day of this dictation the patient is oriented to person and
time, but not to place, but he is less agitated and is
pleasant and cooperative.  On [**11-17**] he had an episode of
agitation where he removed his tracheostomy, which was
replaced without incident and he has been doing well since
that time.

Access, the patient has a right sided PICC line placed on
[**12-15**], tracheostomy placed [**12-9**] and changed on [**12-18**], PEG
placed on [**12-10**], Foley catheter and he will have a voiding
trial today remains in place at this time.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor 10 mg per G tube q day,
Lopressor 50 mg per G tube b.i.d., intravenous heparin,
regular insulin sliding scale b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg per G
tube q day, Zyprexa 5 mg po q.h.s., Atrovent nebulizers one

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Intubated status post ventricular
fibrillation arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old male with
known coronary artery disease who collapsed suddenly in the
park while standing with his wife by their car.  His wife
started CPR immediately.  EMS was called at 8:56 and arrived
at 9:02.  The patient was found to be unconscious without
pulses or spontaneous breathing.  He was shocked immediately
at 200 joules and 300 joules for ventricular fibrillation and
went into to asystole.  CPR was restarted and patient was
intubated.  He was shocked again at 360 joules for
ventricular fibrillation at 9:08 and went in to
idioventricular rate which then converted to sinus rate.  He
received Amiodarone, heparin and Nitroglycerin drip.

During his ambulance ride to the [**Hospital6 33**], he
went back into ventricular tachycardia again and lost pulses.
He was again shocked at 360 joules for two times and went
back into sinus and stayed in sinus since 9:32.  On his
arrival to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room his heart rate was
80, blood pressure 157/70.  He received 2 mg Versed, 100 mcg
Fentanyl and an 8 mg Pavulon.  His blood pressure dropped to
60/30 for which he was given IV fluids and Dopamine.  His EKG
showed ST elevation in leads III, aVF and ST depression in I,
aVL and V1 through V5 which was suggested of inferior MI.

He was given aspirin, Lopressor and started on a heparin
drip.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for PTCA.  On his arrival to the Cath lab, he was on
Amiodarone and Dopamine drip.  In the Cath lab no acute
changes were identified compared to his last cath done in [**2190-6-9**], therefore no intervention has been performed.  He
tolerated the procedure well and was weaned off Dopamine.  He
remained on Amiodarone drip upon his arrival to the CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post
silent myocardial infarction.  Last cath [**2190-6-9**] at
outside hospital in [**State **].

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 20 mg q.d.
2.  Aspirin 160 q.d.

Cath report at [**Hospital1 69**] showed
left [**Known lastname **] coronary artery 30% of diffuse disease;  LAD, twin
LAD with large diagonal branch with 70% of mid stenosis, mild
LAD disease, left circumflex, occlusion OM1, patent OM2,
occlusion of distal left circumflex with collateral RCA
occlusion with left to right collaterals.   RA pressure with
mean of 15, PA pressure of 46/26 with a mean of 35, wedge of
20.

Chest x-ray shows endotracheal tube and NG tube in
appropriate place, pulmonary edema, left lower lobe collapse
versus consolidation.

EKG post cath with a sinus rate; improved ST depression in V1
to V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He regained his consciousness quickly off
sedation and was extubated without any difficulty on hospital
day #2.  Since he collapsed suddenly while standing, a head
CT Scan was also obtained to rule out any head trauma.  He
had no focal neurological deficit except for some mild
cognitive impairment.  He was evaluated by PT and OT before
discharge and outpatient cognitive therapy was recommended.

Given the test results on admission, the ventricular
fibrillation arrest was likely scar mediated instead of
primary ischemia.  It was evaluated by Electrophysiology
Service and an AICD was placed on hospital day #3 without any
complications.  He had no events on Telemetry while in the
hospital, but decision was made to continue Amiodarone for
arrhythmia prevention.  He had been treated with a seven day
course of Levaquin for possible pneumonia given initial chest
x-ray finding and his low grade temperature of 100.0 F.  He
also received a course of prophylactic Vancomycin and Keflex
for AICD placement.

He complained of chest pain with deep breathing which was
likely due to the CPR and multiple shocks he received prior
to admission.  He was given Tylenol and Tylenol #3 for pain
control since Percocet makes him hallucinate.  He had never
complained of shortness of breath while in the hospital and
maintained O2 saturation in the 90s on room air.  However he
was found to desaturate to 86 with ambulating and two liters
of nasal cannula made his O2 saturation go back to 90,
although he had no complaints of dyspnea during the
desaturation.  He was sent home with temporary O2 supplement.

Since he appeared to improve his O2 saturation with deep
breathing, the desaturation may be due to his inability to
take deep breaths secondary to pain; however given the
toxicity profile of Amiodarone, the patient was advised to
have outpatient pulmonary function tests, thyroid function
tests and liver function test monitoring.

Most recent labs on discharge showed a white count of 9.5,
hematocrit 34.2 and stable, platelets 167, sodium 139,
potassium 4.1, chloride 102, bicarbonate 28, BUN 14,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 99, calcium 8.7, magnesium 1.9, phos
3.0.  PT 12.9, PTT 25, INR 1.2.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 q.d.
2.  Metoprolol 25 b.i.d.
3.  Lisinopril 10 q.d.
4.  Amiodarone 400 b.i.d. for two weeks, 400 q.d. for one
month, 200 q.d. for maintenance.
5.  Lasix 20 mg q.d.
6.  Potassium 20 mEq q.d.
7.  Lovastatin 40 mg q.d.
8.  Sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n.
9.  Keflex 500 q.i.d. for four days.
10. Levaquin 500 q.d. for seven days.
11. Tylenol #3.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:
1.  Device Clinic in one week on [**2190-12-2**] at 1:30 PM.
2.  Outpatient follow up with PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 7474**] [**Name (STitle) 44683**],
cardiologist in [**State **].

ADDENDUM:  Patient also had a transthoracic echocardiogram
performed on admission.  The TTE showed left ventricle cavity
is dilated, overall left ventricular systolic function
severely depressed, ejection fraction less than 15%.  The LV
cavity is also dilated. There is severe global right
ventricle free wall hypokinesis.  The aortic valve appears
grossly normal.  The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal.  There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae.  Trivial mitral valve regurgitation is also seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.  This suggests severely
depressed ejection fraction of less than 15%, may be due to
stunned myocardium secondary to the shocks.  A copy of the
echocardiogram and cath report was given to the patient's
wife.

Pertinent Results:
FINDINGS:  Compared with the most recent non-contrast head CT on
[**2199-4-15**], there is no significant interval change.  The patient is
status post
left frontal craniotomy with two left frontal burr holes.  A
moderately large subdural collection surrounds the left cerebral
convexity, with  discrete foci of hyperdense material,
consistent with hemorrhage.  This is not significantly increased
in amount, extent from two days earlier.  A small amount of
nondependent pneumocephalus is also unchanged.  Left to right
subfalcine herniation measures 6 mm at the level of the septum
pellucidum, previously 8 mm.  There is no new intra- or
extra-axial hemorrhage. Encephalomalacia in right MCA
distribution is consistent with patient's old known infarct.
Dense calcifications overlying the falx cerebri, and bilateral
cerebellar dentate nuclei.  No fracture is identified.
Significant rotation at the axis of C1-[**5-15**] be positional and
was not present on [**2199-4-17**].  Soft tissue thickening within
the spinal canal at the C2 lateral recess could represent
tortuous vessels.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No significant interval change in the size or appearance of
a large
left-sided subdural hematoma status post craniotomy via two
frontal burr
holes.  A tiny amount of hemorrhage is unchanged in amount or
distribution
from two days earlier, and a small amount of pneumocephalus
remains present.  Subfalcine herniation is either stable or
slightly improved.
2.  Significant rotation at C1-2 is likely positional.  Clinical
correlation is requested.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] F with recurrent SDH, presents with Ventricular fibrillation
arrest, shocked x6, STEMI, no cath performed.

1. ST-Elevation myocardial infarction:
Based on EKG, likely had a LCx lesion, which was medical managed
given recent subdural hematoma.  No cath/intervention was needed
given very high risk for IC rebleed. No plavix given. She did
receive ASA 81 QD, metoprolol, statin, and started ACEI.  ECHO
was done that showed decrement in EF and new wall motion
abnormalities in comparison to [**2198-4-14**].

2. Vfib arrest:
This occured in the setting of STEMI s/p shock x6 and lido gtt
initially started. Upon arrival to the CCU, she was started on
amiodarone oral load and continued on maintanence dose.

3. Afib: During this hosp course, she developed new-onset afib,
rate in 70-80's. She started amiodarone 200 mg and BB as needed
for rate control. She remains in atrial fib but is well
controlled with her rate.

4. Neuro: Repeat CT head showed no new IC hematoma or worsening
ICB. Per neurosurgery, the risk of rebleeding in her case if
>20%. If she were to have rebleed, she would have to be taken to
the OR and she would be very high risk for surgery given her
STEMI. Therefore after family discussion, decided to hold off of
on any further interventions or anticoagulation for now.

5. Vent: She was extubated on [**2199-4-17**] without any events.

6. UTI:  UA was checked when patient had mental status change in
the setting of an elevated WBC.  Cipro was started with plan for
7 days.
6. FEN: Regular heart-healthy diet.
7. PPX: pneumoboots, PPI, HOB elevation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 yo male found down on side of road with
abrasions to the face. Per wife, they had just bought a bicycle
and the patient was riding it home with the wife driving ahead
in a car. She said he was not traveling at a particularly fast
pace, but she got ahead of him and proceeded home. The next she
heard he had been found down on the wrong side of the road. Per
wife, pt was an avid biker prior to his MI in [**2182**] and would not
have ridden on the wrong side of the road, so something must
have happened to cause him to swerve that way. The patient was
found down, apneic and without a pulse.  He was defibrillated
x3, received CPR, epi/vaso, and intubated in the field.

In the ED, he was evaluated by trauma surgery, pan-CT, rib
fractures and pulmonary contusions but no obvious active
hemorrhage.  The patient was noted to have a flail chest,
presumably from ?CPR vs. trauma.  The patient was noted to have
ST depressions inferiorly.
The patient was initiated on a cooling regimen, getting
cisatracurium, versed, fentanyl. In the ED, BPs 130s/80s,
HR-70s-80s.

Unable to obtain review fo symptoms as pt was intubated and
unresponsive. Per wife, pt had not had any anginal symptoms
prior to this event. No chest pain or shortness of breath
recently, and she reports that this is something he would report
to her if it occurred. He had only just begun biking again. He
has a history of stent placement to the LAD in [**2182**] at [**Hospital1 2025**]. At
that time, he presented with restrosternal chest pain with
exertion x 2, the second episode persistent, leading to ED
presentation. Found to have NSTEMI with positive biomarkers. She
said that he is very organized with medications and always takes
them as directed, and has not missed doses.

Imaging:
CT Head non-contrast ([**5-5**]): There is no evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally
midline structures.  There is no cerebral edema or loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation to suggest an acute ischemic
event.  The sulci and ventricles are slightly prominent, likely
age related involutional changes.  There is no hydrocephalus.
The basal cisterns are patent.  Imaged paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells appear well aerated.  No acute fracture is
seen.
  IMPRESSION:
No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
CT C-spine ([**5-5**]):
There is no evidence of acute cervical spine fracture or
malalignment. A
non-displaced fracture of the right first rib is noted. No
significant
degenerative changes are seen including no evidence of critical
central canal stenosis.  Evaluation of the prevertebral soft
tissues is limited due to endotracheal and orogastric tube
placement.  Ground-glass opacities in the imaged lung apices are
better assessed on CT torso of the same date.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of acute cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
Non-displaced fracture of the right first rib.
.
CT Torso ([**5-5**]):
1.  Right upper and middle lobe ground-glass opacities, most
likely
representing areas of contusion and aspiration. Bilateral lower
lobe
consolidations, which may reflect atelectasis or aspiration.
2.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures, including displaced right
anterior rib fractures, likely related to recent CPR.  No
pneumothorax.
3.  Severe coronary artery calcifications.
4.  Decreased liver attenuation, possibly suggestive of fatty
deposition.
.
CXR ([**5-7**]):
There is an endotracheal tube and a feeding tube whose distal
tip is not well seen.  There is unchanged stable cardiomegaly.
There are multiple right-sided rib fractures.  There are areas
of increased density within the right lung, possibly due to
contusion related to the rib fractures.  No pneumothoraces are
seen.
.

stenosis.
.
CTA CHEST [**2187-5-9**]:
TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained from the
thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis prior to and following the
uneventful administration of 120 cc Omnipaque intravenous
contrast.  Coronally and sagittally reformatted images were
generated and reviewed.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The pulmonary arterial tree is well
opacified with intravenous contrast to the subsegmental levels
without filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism.  The
pulmonary arterial trunk is normal in caliber.  The thoracic
aorta is also normal in caliber without evidence of acute aortic
syndrome.  There is a left-sided central venous catheter in
place with the tip terminating in the SVC.  There is a normal
three-vessel takeoff from the aortic arch.  The great vessels
are otherwise unremarkable.  The heart is normal in size without
pericardial effusion.  There are dense calcifications of the
coronary arteries.
No pathologically enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph
nodes are
detected.  The tracheobronchial tree is patent to the
subsegmental levels.  An endotracheal tube appears appropriately
positioned.  An orogastric tube is also seen coursing through
the esophagus and terminating in the stomach.  The thyroid gland
is unremarkable.

There is a moderate-sized right pneumothorax which is new from
[**2187-5-5**].  A
right-sided chest tube is in place with the tip terminating
posterior to be lung which is inadequately positioned.  Within
the pulmonary parenchyma, there are diffuse nodular and
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities predominantly in the right lung with more
confluent regions of consolidation in the right lung base and
left lung base.  No pleural effusions are present.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver enhances
homogeneously without
evidence of hepatic laceration.  No focal liver lesion is
identified.  No
intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation is seen.
The gallbladder contains dense material layering in the
dependent portions consistent with vicarious excretion of
contrast from prior CT.  No calcified gallstones are seen and
there is no gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid to
suggest acute inflammation.  The spleen is unremarkable.  Two
splenules are incidentally noted at the splenic hilum.  The
pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands, and kidneys are
unremarkable.
The intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are
unremarkable without evidence of wall thickening or obstruction.
 There is no free air or ascites.  No pathologically enlarged
lymph nodes are identified in the retroperitoneal or mesenteric
regions.  The intra-abdominal aorta and its branches are normal
in caliber and patent.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is
relatively
decompressed by a Foley catheter in place.  Loculated gas is
again seen in the dome of the bladder likely related to Foley
placement.  The rectum, prostate, seminal vesicles and sigmoid
colon are unremarkable.  There is no free pelvic fluid/inguinal
or pelvic lymphadenopathy.  A small fat-containing left inguinal
hernia is incidentally noted.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are multiple displaced fractures
involving the
right anterior second, third, fourth, fifth and a minimally
displaced fracture involving the right anterolateral sixth rib.
There are fractures at the right costochondral cartilage at the
levels of the right second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs.
Nondisplaced fractures are seen involving the right posterior
fifth, sixth and seventh ribs.  The spine appears intact.
Subcutaneous air is seen in the right thorax and overlying the
sternum.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Moderate-sized right pneumothorax is new from [**2187-5-5**] with a
posteriorly positioned right chest tube which is not adequately
draining the pneumothorax.
2.  Bibasilar pulmonary consolidations and nodular and confluent
opacities in the right lung most likely represent areas of
aspiration/atelectasis and contusion, respectively.
3.  Multiple rib fractures and fractures of the right
costochondral cartilage.
4.  Severe coronary artery calcifications.  No evidence of acute
aortic injury or acute intra-abdominal pathology.
.
CT CHEST [**2187-5-10**]: FINDINGS:  A previously large pneumothorax,
barely visible on chest
radiograph, is tiny.  Minimal residual air is seen in the right
lung base
(401B:14) adjacent to the right atrium (401B:21).  Multifocal
consolidations
in the right middle lobe have coalesced to a larger
consolidation with air
bronchograms (2:40).  The right lower lobe remains completely
collapsed.  The
left lower lobe is completely collapsed, whereas previously the
superior
segment of the left lower lobe remained aerated.  Ground-glass
opacity in the
posterior right upper lobe (2:36) has coalesced into a small
consolidation.

Small amount of pneumomediastinum is similar.  Coronary artery
calcifications
in the LAD and proximal circumflex are similar.  The heart is
mildly enlarged.
The great vessels are normal caliber.  The aortic arch is free
of
calcifications.  A left-sided PICC line tip terminates in the
low SVC.  An
enteric catheter courses into the stomach.

This study was not designed to evaluate sub-diaphragmatic
contents.  The
hypodense liver is consistent with diffuse steatosis.  A 2 cm CC
x 4.3 cm TV
hyperdense lesion at the left liver capsular edge (401B:25) was
hypodense on
the portal venous phase of prior imaging studies. A smaller 3.2
cm TV x 1.2 cm
CC similarly hyperattenuating lesion is located along the
superior liver edge
in segment II (401B:25).

Displaced overriding rib fractures of the anterior right 2nd
through fifth
ribs are unchanged.  There are no lytic or sclerotic bone
lesions concering
for malignancy.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Tiny residual right pnuemothorax has improved
2.  Progressive bilateral lower lobe collapse
3.  Worsening right middle and left upper lobe pneumonia
4.  Fatty liver with two large hyperdense lesions in the left
lobe which are
more conspicuous on the present study.  These lesions are
non-specific and
could represent benign or malignent entities.  An abdominal MRI
is required
for further characterization when the patient's acute issues
have stabalized.
.
CT HEAD [**2187-5-10**]:
FINDINGS:  There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
territorial
infarction.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration.
The basal cisterns remain patent and there is no evidence of
central
herniation.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is unchanged.
 There is
mild mucosal thickening and there is an air-fluid level in the
right maxillary
and sphenoid sinuses, likely related to intubation.  The mastoid
air cells and
middle ear cavities are clear.

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.  MRI is more
sensitive for
evidence of anoxic brain injury.
.
RUQ ULTRASOUND [**2187-5-13**]:
FINDINGS:  The liver is normal in shape and contour.  There is
no increased echogenicity.  In the left lobe of the liver, there
is a small 1.5 x 1.5 cm hypoechoic lesion which does not have a
corresponding lesion seen in the prior CTs.  There is no
increased vascularity.  The portal vein is patent.
The gallbladder is unremarkable without evidence of
cholelithiasis.  Mild
echogenicity within the gallbladder likely represents artifact,
or less likely a small amount of sludge.  There is no
gallbladder wall edema or
pericholecystic fluid.  The common bile duct measures 4 mm.
There is no
intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation.  There is no
ascites.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.  Hazy
echogenicity within the gallbladder is likely artifact, although
a small amount of sludge may be present.
2.  Indeterminate lesion in the left lobe of the liver.
Recommend nonemergent followup with MRI for further evaluation.
.
[**5-16**] CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS: CT CHEST:  The thyroid gland
contains an 8-mm hypodense lesion in the inferior
left lobe (2:13).  No axillary or supraclavicular
lymphadenopathy is seen.
Shotty lymph nodes in the mediastinum do not meet CT size
criteria for
lymphadenopathy.  An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip
terminating at
the level of the clavicles.  An orogastric tube is in place.  A
left-sided
PICC line is seen with the tip terminating in the low SVC.  The
pulmonary
arterial trunk is normal in caliber as is the thoracic aorta.
There is a
normal three-vessel takeoff from the aortic arch.  The heart is
normal in size
without pericardial effusion.  Calcification of the coronary
arteries is noted
with a possible stent in the left anterior descending artery.

The central tracheobronchial tree is patent to the subsegmental
levels.  There
are no pleural effusions.  There is a recurrent small right
pneumothorax with
air seen in the cardiophrenic recess and the base of the right
lung (2:43, 48)
with slight leftward shift of the mediastinal structures.
Multifocal
consolidations have coalesced to predominantly bibasilar
consolidations with
air bronchograms (2:43).  There is residual ground-glass
opacification in the
right upper lobe (2:30).  A right-sided chest tube is unchanged
in position,
extending through the fissure with the tip terminating in the
right lung apex.
There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema extending through the
soft tissues
of the right thorax and also the right posterior neck.

CT ABDOMEN:  Evaluation of solid organs is limited without
intravenous
contrast.  Within these limitations, the liver is diffusely
hypoattenuating
consistent with hepatic steatosis.  No gross liver abnormality
is detected.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation is seen.
The gallbladder
contains diffuse hyperdensity consistent with biliary sludge.  A
solitary
coarse calcification is noted in the head of the pancreas which
is otherwise
unremarkable.  The spleen, bilateral adrenal glands and kidneys
are
unremarkable.  Two splenules measuring 1.9 cm and 2.9 cm are
incidentally
noted in the splenic hilum.

An enteric feeding tube is in place within the stomach.  The
stomach and
intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable
without
evidence of wall thickening or obstruction.  No free air or
ascites is
present.  There is no appreciable mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy.  The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber with
minimal
atherosclerosis.

CT PELVIS:  The prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
The urinary
bladder is decompressed by a Foley catheter with a locule of air
in the
nondependent portion of the bladder dome consistent with Foley
placement.  The
rectum and sigmoid colon are mildly distended with stool but
otherwise
unremarkable.  There is no free pelvic fluid or inguinal/pelvic
lymphadenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions
are detected.
Minimal degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar spine, most
pronounced at
the L2-3 level with loss of intervertebral disc space, endplate
sclerosis and
osteophytosis.  Displaced overriding rib fractures of the
anterior right
2nd-5th ribs are unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Recurrent small right pneumothorax with slight leftward
deviation of
mediastinal structures from [**2187-5-10**].

2.  Improved multifocal pneumonia with persistent bibasilar
consolidation
likely due to lower lobe collapse.

3.  Persisting ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe.

4.  Hepatic steatosis.

5.  Hyperdense gallbladder consistent with biliary sludge.

6.  No evidence of colitis or intra-abdominal abscess.
.
[**5-16**]/ MRI HEAD:
FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage,
infarction, mass effect,
or edema seen.  Ventricles and sulci appear age appropriate.
Major
intracranial flow voids are preserved.  There is fluid signal in
the sphenoid
sinuses, nasopharynx and mastoid air cells bilaterally, which
might be related
to intubation.  Visualized orbits appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial abnormality.
.
[**5-16**] MRI CSPINE
FINDINGS: Limited examination due to patient motion. Cervical
vertebrae are
normal in height, marrow signal intensity and alignment.
Craniocervical
junction is normal.  Cervical spinal cord shows normal
morphology and signal
intensity.

At C2-C3, uncovertebral and facet joint osteophytes result in
moderate right
neural foraminal narrowing.  There is no significant spinal
canal or left
neural foraminal narrowing.

At C3-C4, there is disc bulge effacing the anterior thecal sac
remodeling the
cord, but no cord signal abnormality is seen.  There is no
significant neural
foraminal narrowing.

At C4-C5 and C5-C6, there are disc bulges without significant
canal or neural
foraminal narrowing.

At C6-C7, there is a disc bulge with central disc protrusion
indenting the
anterior thecal sac but no significant canal or neural foraminal
narrowing is
seen.  At C7-T1, there is no significant spinal canal or neural
foraminal
narrowing.

Pre- and para-vertebral soft tissues appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:  Study limited by patient motion. Mild degenerative
changes in the
cervical spine without significant spinal canal or neural
foraminal narrowing.
.
[**5-17**] EMG: Complex, abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic
evidence for a
generalized, sensorimotor polyneuropathy characterized by axonal
loss, which
is at least moderately severe. However, the complete absence of
identifiable
motor unit activity in upper and lower extremities with
relatively normal
motor nerve conduction studies is consistent with a primary
upper motor neuron
etiology for the patient's weakness. The associated finding of
normal cranial
EMG supports a localization within the cervical spinal cord.

There is no evidence for a presynaptic neuromuscular
transmission disorder.
.
[**5-19**] MRI HEAD AND CSPINE: CONCLUSION:  Hyperintense lesions in
the medulla and upper cervical cord, not
detectable on diffusion images.  Small right frontal white
matter
hyperintensity.  These findings may all be a consequence of
ischemia, but they
do not appear acute by MR criteria.
.
[**5-22**] TTE: LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid- and
distal septal hypokinesis (mid-LAD territory). The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
 .
[**5-24**] VIDEO SWALLOW STUDY
FINDINGS:  Video swallow fluoroscopy was performed in
conjunction with speech
and swallow division.  Multiple consistencies of barium were
administered.
Barium passed freely through the esophagus without evidence of
obstruction.
There was aspiration with thin and nectar consistencies, which
improved on
chin tuck.  There was mild pharyngeal residue with pureed
consistencies but no
aspiration or penetration.

IMPRESSION:  Mild aspiration of thin and nectar consistencies
which improved
with chin tuck.  Pharyngeal residue with pureed consistency.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with coronary artery disease
(CAD) status post stent to proximal LAD in [**2182**], hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was found down
on side of road in ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest
s/p resuscitation and intubation.  He underwent cardiac cath
with placement of DES to mid-LAD, and post-cath arctic sun
cooling protocol.  He had an ICD placed before discharge for a
primary vfib arrest.  His course was complicated by rib
fractures and resultant right pneumothorax requiring chest tube
and ventilator-associated psuedomonas pneumonia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Primary Vfib arrest: Although he had a history of CAD and is
s/p drug eluding stent (DES) to proximal left anterior
descending (LAD) in [**2182**], he had been doing well prior to this
incident.  He was found down after riding a bike home, requiring
multiple shocks for ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest in the
field and endotracheal intubation for respiratory failure.
Arctic Sun Cooling protocol was initiated in the ED on arrival.
He was taken for cardiac cath and recieved DES to mid-LAD on
[**2187-5-5**].  Transferred to the CCU post-cath where he has been
hemodynamically stable and cooled to 33'C. He was placed on
neuromuscular blockade (cisatracurium) as well as fentanyl and
versed.  Monitored on EEG for seizure activity while on NM
block, no seizures seen. After 24 hours cooling was stopped and
warming protocol initiated. NM block discontinued after patient
reached 35'C per protocol.

After rewarming, he remained became mildly hypertensive so he
was restarted on home antihypertensives, which included
metoprolol and lisinopril (takes captopril at home).  He began
to trend towards fevers (see below) so he was continued on artic
sun device which kept him maintained at 37'C with cooling for an
additional 48 hours. He was not extubatable after warming so
tube feeds were initiated and he was transitioned to
fentanyl/propofol. He was treated for MI with plavix 75mg daily,
aspirin 325mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, metoprolol
tartrate 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].

Patient remained ventilator-dependent for 14 days.  Sedation was
changed to precedex nearing extubatation. After additional
management of his pneumothorax and pneumonia (see below) he was
successfully extubated on [**5-18**] without complication.

There were many discussions about whether his vifb was secondary
to acute MI or not, and ultimately it was felt that there was
not evidence to confirm either way.  Since he may have had a
primary vfib arrest (due to previous MI in [**2182**] and structural
heart disease), he was a candidate for ICD placement during this
admission.  He had an ICD placed on [**2187-5-25**] and tolerated the
procedure well.  CXR the following day confirmed lead placement
and interrogation by the EP team showed that it was functioning
well. He should keep dressing on for three days, take keflex 500
mg 4x/d for 3 days, and follow-up in [**Hospital **] clinic.

# Pneumothorax: Patient developed crepitus on exam the morning
of hospital day 4 while still intubated. CXR revealed right
apical pneumothorax and trauma surgery placed a pigtail catheter
on [**2187-5-8**].  Initially, this tube drained air and serosanguinous
fluid and repeat CXR showed improvement in the pneumothorax.
However, the following day his ventilator oxygenation
requirements did not improve.  He was requiring very high PEEP
and FiO2 90-100% to maintain saturations in the low to mid 90s.
His blood pressures were also noted be decreased during this
time.  Because the differential included pulmonary embolus and
he was not clinically improving, a CTA chest was performed on
[**2187-5-9**].  This showed a large persistent right pneumothorax
which was layered anteriorly and thus not visible on portable
CXRs and the apical pigtail catheter was inadequately placed to
drain.  He also had basal pneumonia.  Trauma surgery returned
and placed a right chest tube on [**2187-5-9**] with repeat CT chest
the following day showing resolution of pneumothorax. He
ventilator dependence and mild hypotension improved following
chest tube placement. It was successfully removed on [**5-20**]
wihtouth recurrence of PTX.

# Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP): Upon rewarming from the
arctic sun protocol, the patient was noted to be persistently
febrile.  When he became hypoxic with increasing vent
requirements, he was started on empiric coverage for VAP in
addition to treatment of pneumothorax as above.  He remained
febrile and sputum culture grew pseudomonas so ciprofloxacin was
added to the regimen while awaiting sensitivities.  Pseudomonas
was pan-sensitive so he was narrowed to ciprofloxacin only.
However, he remained febrile so vanc and cefepime were added
back on. Flagyl was added to his regimen on [**5-15**] for anaerobic
coverage given fevers and concern for aspiration.  Vancomycin
and ciprofloxacin were subsequently weaned off and he completed
a 8 day course of cefepime and metronidazole from [**5-16**], which was
the last day of positive sputum cultures.

# Mental status: Initially we were unable to assess while pt was
being cooled and sedated. Though he was resuscitated, amount of
time he was pulseless was unknown. Patient had EEG performed
early in his stay which showed mild/moderate diffuse background

Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo man with an extensive medical history (HTn, CHF, AF, ARF
on HD, CAD s/p MI, enlarged prostate) including a complicated
hospital course over the past few months c/b GIB, MI, heart
failure, acute renal failure, PNA and lft femeral embolization;
who presents s/p VF arrest during hemodialysis.

1) VFib arrest: Per outside records, Pt in observed VF
successfully cardioverted after [**2-27**] shocks and initiation of
lidocaine gtt.  Upon presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], Pt was intubated,
stable and in sinus ryhthm.  Maintained on tele with small runs
of NSVT.  In the AM, Pt succesfully extubated without problem.
Pt remained HD stable.  ECGs were without evidence of recent
infarction.  After cardiac catherization, Pt evaluated by EP for
possibility of AICD.  Given Pt's recent h/o VF and known CAD
with EF<30%, an AICD was placed without complication [[**Last Name (un) 24119**] VR
ICD (No DFT as pt in chronic AF)].  Throughout the hospital stay
Pt was in/out of AF and with episodes of NSVT, that improved
daily.

2) AF: Pt with known AF, however not anticoagulated given recent
GIB from a known antral ulcer.  Pt currently on Protonix q12hr
after being treated for known Hpylorri gastritis.  Given Pt's
risk for thromboemboli events given history and AF, it was
decided to restart Pt on coumadin.  Decision was discussed with
GI fellow, who agreed with the current regimen of PPI and
recommended to closely monitor stools of occult blood.  During
hospital stay, Pt was guiaic negative and HCt stable after an
initial transfusion to get Hct >28.  Pt should have regular
stool guiaics and if bleed suspected, Pt gastroenterologist
should be contact[**Name (NI) **] for repeat endoscopy.

3) CAD/CHF: Pt with known CAD and EF 20% secondary to ischemic
cardiomyopathy, details of cath in results section.  Given Pt's
h/o recent MI and known CAD, Pt continued on BB, statin and ASA.
 Given Pt's poor renal function and possibility of recovery,
ACEi was not indicated.

4)RF:  Pt with relatively new renal failure possibly secondary
to obstructive uropathy.  Renal consulted for help in management
of hemodialysis.  Pt normally recieves HD 3times a week and
still makes decent urine output on non-HD days.  Nephrology were
optomistic that Pt may not be completely HD dependent and
initial w/u including 24 hour urine studies started.

5) GU:  Pt with elevated PSA and known prostatic hypertrophy.
Urology consulted who recommended Pt upon discharge continue
with foley catheter.  They would like to see him in a few weeks
in outpatient clinic in regards to probable TURP. Pt has been
instructed to call them at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 772**] and make an
appointment for the next few weeks.

6) GI: Pt with h/o antral ulcer and Hpylorri gastritis, being
treated with Protonix [**Hospital1 **] after HPylorri irradication.  While on
anticoagulation Pt should have stools monitored and any signs of
blood loss reported to PCP.

History of Present Illness:
39 year old female transfered from [**Hospital3 **] s/p cardiac
arrest. The patient used heroin, possibly cocaine, and possibly
benzodiazepines last night and was altered, but her boyfriend
did not do anything until this morning when she was
unresponsive. At [**Hospital1 **], she was altered and had some
improvement with naloxone. After a period of observation, she
became unresponsive, had a wide complex tachycardia and no
pulse. She was intubated with propofol and vecuronium. She
recevived bicarb and epinephrine. Labs came back with a
potassium of 7.4 so she was given insulin/D50 and calcium. After
brief CPR, she regained pulses. She was persistently hypotensive
so a right femoral CVL was placed and phenylephrine gtt started
along with bicarb gtt. She was on propofol for sedation and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. At [**Hospital1 **] she revieved 3L NS.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, after transferring from EMS stretcher no pulse
was felt. CPR was initiated and one 2 minute cycle was
perfromed, epinephrine, calcium, bicarb all were all given once.
Regained pulses. ETT confirmed w/ CXR and ETCO2. A left femoral
a-line was placed (not sterile). She was then tranferred to the
MICU for futher management.

On arrival to the MICU, Vitals were Temp: 99, HR: 98, BP: 126/67
RR: 28 O2: 100%. Vent settings were AC Tv: 450 RR: 24 PEEP: 5.
She was non-responsive and the artic sun protocol was initiated.
Her left and right femoral lines were removed and a left CVL was
placed as was a left arterial line.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

EEG [**2109-6-30**]
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. The EEG
background showed the slow cortical activity and bursts of
generalized slowing throughout indicative of severe diffuse
encephalopathy. It did not change appreciably over the course of
the recording. Compared with the recording yesterday, the
background was slightly slower which might be due to medication
adjustment. There were no clearly epileptiform features, and
there were no electrographic seizures.

CT Head [**2109-6-30**]
FINDINGS:  There are EEG electrodes in place. There is no
evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or recent
infarction.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration.  No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
Fluid-opacification of the nasopharynx and nasal cavity, with
layering fluid in the sphenoid and ethmoidal air cells and
maxillary sinuses, likely relates to intubation and supine
positioning.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  If
there is
concern for acute hypoxic-ischemic injury, MRI would be more
sensitive.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is some loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter
differentiation, diffusely, concerning for cerebral edema, in
this context.

CT Chest [**2109-6-30**]
FINDINGS:  Evaluation is slightly limited in the absence of
intravenous
contrast; however, the mediastinal vessels appear normal in
caliber.  There is no pericardial effusion.  There are
widespread extensive areas of consolidation and atelectasis
extending from the hila bilaterally towards the bases.  As seen
on coronal images, these consolidations superimpose on the
mediastinum and likely contribute to the apparent mediastinal
widening seen on the prior radiograph, which also relates partly
to vascular prominence and  mediastinal fat.  No pneumothorax is
present.  No significant pleural effusion is seen.  An
endotracheal tube is in place with tip in the distal trachea.
An esophageal catheter courses inferior to the diaphragm.

No concerning osseous lesion is seen.  Limited views of the
upper abdomen
demonstrate coiling of esophageal catheter within the stomach,
though the
entire course is not visualized.  Otherwise, no upper abdominal
abnormality is seen.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of mediastinal vascular injury.
Extensive bilateral consolidations extending from the hila
consistent with aspiration pneumonia.

CXR [**2109-6-30**]
The left internal jugular central line has been repositioned so
that its tip now lies in the proximal SVC.  The endotracheal
tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular dual-lumen
catheter are unchanged in position.  The diffuse airspace
process appears to have somewhat cleared, although there is a
persistent opacity throughout both lungs and therefore this
would favor resolving pulmonary edema rather than diffuse
pneumonia or ARDS.  Stable overall cardiac and mediastinal
contours.  No pneumothorax.  Probable small bilateral layering
effusions.

Echocardiogram [**2109-7-1**]
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal
diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global biventricular systolic function. No valvular pathology or
pathologic flow identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 39 year old with a history of diabetes who was found
down after heorin, and possibly other illicit substances
overdose presenting to first to [**Hospital3 4107**]. While at [**Hospital1 **] she went in to ventricular fibrillation pulseless
arrest and was resuscitated. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED she underwent PEA
arrest and was [**Last Name (un) 7162**] resuscitated. She was transfered to the MICU
futher management. In addition to her cardiac arrest she was
found to be hyperkalemic, have a transaminitis, leukocytosis,
rhabodomyolysis, and acute renal failure in addition to her know
diabetes mellitus.

#Cardiac arrest and shock: multifactorial etiology including
illicit drugs and hyperkalemia. She was unresponsive after
resuscitation in [**Hospital1 18**] ED although she regained a pulse. On
transfer to the MICU she was on vasopressor support, intubated
and sedated. Her troponin, which was initially elevated,
decreased subsequently.  A central venous line was placed in her
left internal jugular vein and a arterial line was placed in her
left radial artery. The decision was made to initiate theraputic
hypothermia for neurologic protection. She was cooled to 33
degrees and rewarmed over a 24 hour period. During the
theraputic hypothermia protocal she was monitored by
electroencephalogram. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram was
performed which showed no abnormal findings. She was difficult
to wean off of sedation and pressor support due to agitation.
She initially did not follow commands when sedation was
lightened. She self extubated and was able to maintain her
airway and oxygenation on supplemental oxygen. At the time of
extubation she was awake and aware x3. On [**2109-7-8**] she was
transferred to the floor in good condition with no neurologic
deficits.

#Hyperkalemia: Most likely due to hypoperfusion in the setting
of shock. Elevated to 7.4 at [**Hospital1 **] and was given kayexalate,
bicarbonate, and calcium. On arrival to the MICU the decision
was made to perfrom dialysis. Nephrology was consulted.
Hemodialysis was permored once on [**2109-6-30**] and then
discontinued.

#Transaminitis: Most likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis or
hypoperfusion but we could not rule out viral hepatitis with her
history of intravenous drug use. Liver enzymes were trended.
Hepatitis B and C serologies were found to be positive.

#Aspiration Pneumonia: Initially her white count was elevated to
approximately 30.0 there was concern that this could be due to
septic shock vs acute phase reaction in the setting of cardiac
arrest. She was empirically treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics considering that other markers such as fever or
subjective complaints could not be assessed during theraputic
hypothermia. A CT chest done to evaluate a wide mediastinum in
the ED showed extensive bilateral consolidations extending from
the hila consistent with aspiration pneumonia. She was continued
on cefepime and metronidazole for a total of eight days. Her
sputum grew out gram negative rods consistant with an aspiration
source. She was switched to meropenem however she continued to
be persistently febrile and have a leukocytosis.  Sputum Cx were
found to be growing stenotrophomonas sensitive to bactrim. Pt
completed a full course of meropenem and was discharge on PO
bactrim to complete a 14 day course. Other possible sources of
infection include a dental abscess given her poor dentition.
Prior to admission pt was on an antibiotic for presumed tooth
infection since she was to follow up with dental clinic for a
tooth extraction.  Dental came to see pt while in house and
determined that she does not have an acute infection that was
contributing to her fevers and leukocytosis.

#Widended Mediastinum: A chest xray showed a wide mediastinum.
Given the patients inability to communicate and her cardiac
arrest a CT of her chest was done to futher characterize her
widened mediastinum. The CT showed no evidence of mediastinal
vascular injury.

#Rhabdomyolysis: On admission she had an elevated creatinine
kinase that subsequently peaked at approximately 13,000 and then
decreased. Her rhabdomyolysis is most likely due to being down
at home after toxic ingestion and exacerbated by her acute renal
failure. She was given intravenous fluids, her creatinine kinase
was trended, and a bicarbonate drip was started and subsequently
discontinued prior to theraputic hypothermia. Her creatinine
kinase trended downward consistantly over her time in the MICU.


#Acute Renal Failure: On admission her creatinine was 2.2. This
was most likely due to hypoperfusion and exacerbated by
rhabodomyolysis. With intravenous fluid and hemodialysis her
creatinine decreased to within normal reference range.

#Diabetes: This is a chronic stable issue. She was not
hyperglycemic when found unresponsive so there is little concern
of a diabetic ketoacidosis component. Her blood glucose maintain
within normal ranges on a insulin sliding scale.

#Chest pain: Pt experienced a single episode of chest pain while
on the medical floors post ICU which last 6 hours. EKG did not
reveal any acute changes but she was found to have elevated
troponins with a peak (.11->.14->.12).  She was started on
aspirin and beta-blocker for NSTEMI although the significance of
the elevated troponins in the setting of post cardiac arrest is
not certain given that her troponin level was in the range of
.05-.09 in the post arrest setting and there were no troponin
levels for several days prior to the chest pain. We recommend
that the patient have a cardiac stress test as an outpatient to
evaluate for ischemia and CAD given this episode.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Patient was hepatitis C positive, should be followed up with
her PCP upon discharge.
-Pt should have a cardiac stress test as an outpatient given
single episode of chest pain and rise in trops while in the
hosptial
-Pt is to follow up at the [**Hospital1 2177**] dental clinic for dental work and
possible tooth extraction

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**] is a 71 year old man with severe COPD, oxygen
dependant complicated by polycythemia, who was in his usual
state of health when he ran out of oxygen at a Red Sox game. His
son in law went to car to retrieve another gas tank and
meanwhile the patient was with out O2 for approximately 15 min.
His son called for help and EMS arrived with their own O2. At
that time, Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**] was not mentating well, placed on
stretcher and then went into respiratory arrest. The patient
went limp and they started bagging patient. He was then noted to
be in v fib arrest as well. He was given IV EPI with one shock
and placed back in rhythm. He was given lopressor for the
resulting sinus tachycardia. Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**] was brought to this
facility for further care.

Chest CTA: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Dependent

emphysematous changes.

Of note, his CT head was negative.


Brief Hospital Course:
Cardiovascular: Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**]' v fib arrest was attributed to his
his prolonged hypoxia while without his O2. Upon admission the
patient received asa 500 mg PR, solumedrol 125 mg x1, levaquin,
lopressor, calcium carbonate, and propofol. He was admitted to
CCU for acute coronary syndrome and started on aspirin,
atorvastin, metoprolol and captopril. His EKG showed diffuse ST
segment depression that could either be consistent with global
hypoperfusion secondary to his arrest or to left main disease.
His cardiac enzymes were positive secondary to demand and to his
low blood pressure. Once past the acute event, his EKG
normalized. His echocardiogram was negative for tamponade and
showed an EF of >55%. His cholesterol panel was at goal with an
LDL of 63, so the statin was discontinued. Per outside records,
he had a stress echo in [**2116**] which showed no evidence of
ischemia or diliation. This indicates that he is unlikely to
have left main disease. He was optimized medically with aspirin
and beta blockade, which he [**Year (4 digits) 8337**] well despite his severe
COPD. The metoprolol was considered necessary in spite of the
relative contraindication as it is protective against
arrhythmias.

Pulmonary: In the CCU, Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**] was intially hypercapnic and
acidotic. The hypercapnea resolved but he remained hypoxic,
likely from his pneumonia. He was sedated and intubated for
respiratory failure. His CTA was negative for a pulmonary
embolism. He was started on levofloxacin and flagyl for
aspiration pneumonia. He had  high white cell count (12) at
admission that increased once he was placed on steroid. His
leukocytosis may have been due to a combination of his
pneumonia, and the steroids. On hospital day 2, he was weaned
from the ventilator and given lasix for hypoxia. He was
extubated on hospital day 3 and placed back on O2 via nasal
cannula. He [**Known lastname 8337**] this well except for a few asymptomatic
desaturations to the 70s. His levofloxacin was discontinued
after one dose because of the potential for it to cause QT
prolongation. He was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for
his presumed aspiration pneumonia. His therapy was optimized
with a steroid taper and albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer
treatments.

FEN: Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] his feeds as soon as he was extubated.
He was placed on a cardiac diet.

Musculoskeletal: Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**] is deconditioned and spends a good
deal of his time in bed per patient. Physical therapy and
occupational therapy were consulted and recommended pulmonary
rehab.

He was discharged in fair condition to a pulmonary
rehabilitation facility in [**Location (un) 3844**] in fair condition.

The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly-to-moderately depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent)
secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior free wall and
apex. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior
report (images unavailable for review) of [**2164-2-23**], the
aortic regurgitation is reduced.
.
CARDIAC CATH [**2164-12-14**]
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
patient revealed no angiographically apparent coronary artery
disease.
The LMCA, LAD, LCX, RCA and their branches were without flow
limiting
disease.  The LCx was a small vessel and the lateral wall was
supplied
via RCA.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic pressures of
130/67/88
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal
.
CT HEAD [**2164-12-14**]
1. No intracranial hematoma. Subcutaneous/subgaleal hematoma at
the right frontal region, without underlying skull fracture.
2. No CT features of acute cerebral infarcts. If clinically
indicated, MRI is a more sensitive study to exclude acute
cerebral ischemia.
.
EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a
diffusely
slow background rhythm with bursts of generalized slowing
consistent
with a mild to moderate encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or
anoxic
etiology. No evidence of ongoing or potential seizure activity
was seen
during this tracing.
.
CXR PA and LAT
INDICATION: Newly placed dual chamber ICD. Check position.

FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with the
patient in upright position. There is status post sternotomy,
and in the aortic valve area, the semitranslucent structures of
a butterfly type (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]) aortic valve prosthesis can be
identified. The heart size is now within normal limits and
clearly smaller than on a previous PA and lateral chest
examination of [**2164-8-30**]. A permanent pacer is present in
left anterior axillary position connected to a dual
intracavitary pacing system with termination points in the right
atrial appendage and apical portion of right ventricle
correspondingly. In addition to these wires already present on
examination [**8-30**], there are now two electrodes approach
from the right subclavian route also terminating in right atrial
and right ventricular position as demonstrated on both frontal
and lateral view. The right ventricular wire with two local
electrode enforcements (ICD) traverses from the right axilla
over to the left side where it is connected with the permanent
pacer capsule. The thin right-sided right atrial wire terminates
blindly in the right axilla.

The pulmonary vasculature is normal without evidence of
congestive pattern. No acute infiltrates are seen, and the
lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free. No evidence of
pneumothorax on either side. Comparison with a most recent AP
single view examination of [**2164-12-19**] demonstrates
unchanged findings.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated placement of additional pacer
electrodes for unusual connection, see description. Remarkable
reduction and normalization of heart size since [**8-30**].
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 59 year-old gentleman s/p [**Month (only) 1291**] with re-do in [**8-/2164**]
who presented to an OSH with VFib arrest, tranferred here for
further management. The following issues were addressed during
his hospital stay:
.
# VFIB ARREST/ICD PLACEMENT/HEMATOMA
Exact etiology remains unclear. Laboratory values from OSH not
consistent with acute ischemic event, though ECHO suggested some
new anterior wall motion dysfunction. Patient underwent coronary
catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] which revealed normal coronaries.
Patient reportedly compliant with medications, pacemaker
interrogation successful at OSH. No significant electrolyte
abnormalities or QT interval prolongation noted, blood cultures
negative from OSH. Patient was evaluated by the
Electrophysiology service and ICD was ultimately placed in left
arm with slight difficulty in positioning leads. Course
complicated by hematoma at pacer entry sites (L and R arm),
controlled with pressure dressings. Patient transfused 1 unit
PRBCs given blood loss secondary to hematomas. Given ECHO
findings suggestive of possible ischemic event, patient was
started on Lipitor 10mg PO qd and Toprol XL 100.
.
# RESPIRATORY (INTUBATION)
Patient had been intubated for airway protection at OSH during
arrest episode. Patient successfully extubated at [**Hospital1 18**] the
following day after CXR was unremarkable for pulmonary
pathology. Patient had some stridor post-extubation which was
treated with racemic epinpehrine. No further respiratory issues
were experienced.
.
# NEUROLOGIC (HEAD HEMATOMA/CONFUSION/MEMORY LOSS)
Patient had 2 Head CT scans on day of admission at OSH which
showed sub-galeal hematoma but no intracranial bleeding. Given
amnesia, confusion, and lethargy, patient received repeat Head
CT at [**Hospital1 18**] which was negative for acute bleed, intracranial
mass, or other concerning pathology. Symptoms improved over
time. Patient was evaluated by the neurology service and anoxic
brain injury specialist. No extensive cortical damage, patient
diagnosed with executive dysfunction; some improvement in
function expected over the next 6 months, but prognosis for
returning to work and/or living independently are poor. Patient
received an EEG which showed slowing consistent with
anoxic/toxic injury; no seizure activity was noted. Patient will
follow-up with behavioral neuro service as outpatient. Patient
was discharged to rehab facility under brain injury division for
targeted care. Patient started on Seroquel 25mg PO BID given
agitation/unrest and low dose Trazadone 25mg PO qd for sleep at
night.
.
# PROSTHETIC AORTIC VALVE
Patient had therapeutic INR on presentation to OSH. Patient's
Coumadin was held in preparation for cardiac cath and ICD
placement, and was maintained on heparin gtt in interim.
Coumadin re-started once ICD placed, and patient kept on heparin
gtt until INR therapeutic. Goal INR 2.5-3.5.
.
# L ARM CELLULITIS
Patient developed L arm cellulitis from IV site, treated with PO
Keflex and warm compresses. Patient was afebrile and without
leukocytosis.
.
# HEMATURIA/INCONTINENCE
Patient experienced hematuria while under heparin gtt after
foley was discontinued, likely due to irritation and trauma. PTT
was in therapeutic range, and drip was necessary due to
prosthetic valve. Hematuria improved when transiently off
heparin gtt, and will likely cease once patient off heparin.
Patient also incontinent of urine when nursing staff not
accessible. Patient otherwise able to void normally when
accompanied to the bathroom by nursing. We do not suspect
underlying urinary pathology anf attribute incontinence to
mental status.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29887**] is a 52 yo male with significant PMH significant for
HTN, smoking, who collapsed and hit his head at work this
afternoon. The fall was witnessed by his collegue. There is no
report of chest pain, SOB, or any other symptoms prior to his
fall. He was found to be breathing when he was found down. He
was given 5 minutes of CPR with no respirations. Paramedics
arrived, he was found to be in VF (no strips available)and was
shocked. He remained in a ventricular rhythm with a rate of 20,
and then converted spontaneously to sinus rhythm. Patient had
agonal respirations at the time of the arrest. He was brought to
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] where he was found to have posturing. The patient was
given Ativan, Versed, and Nitro and a CT of the head was done
which suggested subdural hematoma vs. meningioma. EKG showed ST
elevations in 1, aVL, V2-V6. The patient did not receive ASA,
heparin, or integrilin for concern for a possible intracranial
bleed. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization
and closer monitoring.

In the cath lab he was found to have occluded LAD after D1 & S1
and 1 subbranch with long subtotal occlusion with collateral
filling of distal vessel. MiniVision stent was placed into D2.
Hemodynamic parameters as follows: CO 6.5, CI 3.3 and PCWP 23.

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cardiac Catheterization ([**2148-12-13**]): 1.  Selective coronary
angiography in this right dominant system revealed severe two
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had diffuse mild
disease.  The LAD was totally occluded after D1 and S1. The
distal LAD was a small diffusely disease vessel that filled via
right to left collaterals.  The first diagonal was severely
diffusely disease.  The second diagonal was a large vessel with
a large subbranch with a long subtotal occlusion; this vessel
filled distally via collaterals.  The LCx had a 30% proximal and
a 50% mid occlusion. 2.  Left ventriculography was deferred. 3.
Hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided filling
presures.  The LVEDP was 23 mmHg.  The RVEDP was 16 mmHg. There
was pulmonary artery hypertension. Pulmonary artery pressure wa
41/21 mmHg with a mean of 30 mmHg.  Cardiac index was perserved
at 3.25 l/min/m2.

2)C,T,L-spine CT ([**2148-12-14**]): no evidence of fracture or
malalignment.

3)CT head ([**2148-12-15**]): There is a 5-mm hyperdensity along the
right frontal falx of uncertain etiology. There is no evidence
of hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline
structures, hydrocephalus, or infarction. The density values of
the brain parenchyma are within normal limits and the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. The ventricles and sulci
are normal in size. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable. The imaged portions of the
paranasal sinuses are well-aerated.

4)MRI/MRA Head ([**2148-12-16**]): Study is limited due to patient
motion artifact. However, the major vessels of the circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] appear patent. There do not appear to be any large areas
of intracranial atherosclerotic disease. The right vertebral
artery is dominant. There appears to be a fetal origin to the
right posterior cerebral artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29887**] is a 52 yo male with HTN who is now s/p anterolateral
STEMI and VF arrest s/p LAD stent, and s/p intubation. He was
extubated following cardiac catheterization. He remained stable
thereafter, but did have some residual short term memory
deficits.

1)STEMI: The patient had evidence of an anterolateral STEMI and
subsequent Vfib arrest. He was taken to the cath lab where he
was found to have occluded LAD after D1 & S1 and 1 subbranch
with long subtotal occlusion with collateral filling of distal
vessel. A MiniVision stent was placed into the mid-LAD. The
patient was maintained on ASA 325 mg, Lipitor 80mg, Plavix 75mg
daily X 1 month, Lisinopril 10 mg QD, and Metoprolol titrated to
50mg TID. The patient was made a follow up appointment with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], cardiologist.

2)Pump: The patient had an ECHO 2 days after PCI and VF arrest
which showed an EF~ 30% with an akinetic apex. Although the PCWP
23 on cardiac cath, the patient was diuresed during his
hospitalization and was euvolemic on exam by time of discharge.
Given the akinetic apex found on echo and increased risk of clot
formation, the patient was started on a heparin drip as a bridge
to coumadin. Upon discharge the patient's INR was 1.4. He was
discharged on Lovenox SQ and Coumadin. He was told to have his
INR checked on Friday and have the results faxed to Dr.[**Name (NI) 5907**]
office.

3)Rhythm: The patient is s/p vfib arrest secondary to an
anterolateral STEMI. He stayed in normal sinus rhythm throughout
his hospitalization. His Metoprolol was titrated up to 50mg TID.

4)Fall: The patient is s/p posterior head trauma prior to the VF
arrest. Head CT head showed a 5-mm hyperdense focus along
anterior falx. Differential included meningioma vs. bleed. This
focus was thought to be stable after the patient was therapuetic
on heparin. Neurosurgery was involved throughout and recommended
follow-up in [**5-1**] weeks with an outpatient CT and appointment
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. CT of the C- T- and L-spine ruled out fracture.


5)Short term memory: The patient's STM deficit was thought to be
secondary to anoxic brain injury from poor perfusion during the
Vfib arrest. It was stable to slightly improved by the time of
discharge. Both neurology and psychiatry were consulted. They
recommended follow up in the [**Hospital 29888**] clinic for further
testing. A follow up appointment was made with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for this
purpose.

6)Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis was attributed to the
recent STEMI. The patient was clinically asymptomatic and over
the course of the hospitalization. UA and CXR were negative for
UTI and PNA respectively. The leukocytosis slowly improved and
was WNL by discharge.

History of Present Illness:
68 yo male w/ a h/o NIDDM, htn, metastatic prostate cancer to
bone, AF, hyperlipidemia, who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED s/p
cardiac arrest.  The majority of the history is obtained through
medical record review and family report. According to patient's
family, was in his USOH on the morning of presentation.
Recently had complained of intermittent SOB w/o physical
limitation, orthopnea, PND or LE swelling.  Also complained of
increased fatigue following most recent chemotherapy treatment
for prostate ca 2 weeks ago.  On the morning of presentation,
patient with daughter at [**Name (NI) 76573**]working when he was seen
to collapse.  Events and symptoms leading up to collapse unknown
except that patient was carrying multiple heavy bags prior to
event which is not typical of him to do.
.
Per report, initially fell from standing but reportedly awake
and alert intially. He then became unconscious.  First
responders began CPR after ~ 5 minutes unconscious. AED advised
shock once applied and patient came back with perfusing rhythm
for EMS.  He then deteriorated to Vfib, shocked to asystole, and
arrived in [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED with asystole.  There he was intubated
and received amiodarone bolus 300 mg.  He also received 3 rounds
of atropine and 8 rounds of epi. VT persisted after multiple
shocks.  Also received Mgsulfate, bicarb.  Finally regained
perfusing rhythm ~ 30 minutes after initial event. Central line
was placed.  Post arrest ECG showed ST depressions in V3-V6.
Seen by cardiology in [**Location (un) 620**] and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, intial BP 155/65, HR 89.  He was started on
lidocaine gtt. His labs were significant for hypokalemia,
slightly elevated cardiac biomarkers and LFTs and metabolic
acidosis.  His INR was 2.3 on warfarin.  His ECG shows sinus
rhythm with diffuse T wave flattening and slight inferolateral
ST segment depressions.  CXR w/ no acute CP abnormalities and CT
of head and neck which suggested a possible basilar artery
occlusion, but without associated parenchymal changes or
abnormalities.  Neck CT showed no injuries. While in the ED,
patient became hypotensive and more bradycardic and he received
an additional 2 mg of atropine along with a dopamine gtt.
Induced hypothermia cooling protocol also initiated.
.
He was seen by neurology in the ED.  On examination, he
initially had fixed pupils, with right pupillary dilatation, but
without accompanying brainstem signs. On repeat examination 10
minutes later he had reactive pupils, right slightly larger than
left, and otherwise a nonfocal examination. Pupillary
nonreactivity was felt to be most likely secondary to
medications, given the rapid resolution and absence of other
brainstem signs.  MRI/MRA recommended to follow up CT head.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, patient's R femoral central line had
been lose during transport.  Bradycardic to 40s and lidocaine
gtt decreased.  BP fluctuating on dopamine gtt. L femoral line
placed as well as L radial a line. Cooling protocol continued.

[**2130-2-6**] TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad. IMPRESSION: Preserved global biventricular
systolic function. No significant valvular disease seen.

1.  No evidence of displaced fracture or malalignment.
2.  Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine with
continuous ossification along the anterior and posterior
longitudinal
ligaments as well as along the ligamentum flavum.  This raises
the question of an underlying ankylosing spondylitis variant,
or, when taken in conjunction with the dilated esophagus,
possibly a connective tissue disorder.
.
[**2130-2-8**] Left ankle X-ray:
Subacute nondisplaced fracture of the distal left fibula.
Incidental probable myositis ossificans proximal leg.  Depending

.
[**2130-2-16**] Cardiac catheterization:
1.  Coronary angigraphy of this right dominant system revealed
severe
three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had a 60% distal

stenosis.  The LAD was severely diffusely diseased with serial
70-80%
focal stenoses in the mid and distal vessel.  D1 and D2 were
diffusely
diseased with high grade stenoses.  The LCx was a small vessel
with an
80% OM1 lesion.  The RCA was heavily calcified with a diffusely
diseased
PDA and 80% PL branch.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling
pressures
with LVEDP of 25 mm Hg.  Systemic arterial pressures were normal
with
aortic systolic pressure of 119 mm Hg.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation with
anterolateral hypokinesis and LVEF of 40%.
.
[**2130-2-12**] MRI BRAIN
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, edema,
or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber
and configuration. No diffusion abnormalities are detected.
There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration.
IMPRESSION: Normal exam.
.
[**2130-2-12**] MRI THORACIC SPINE
IMPRESSION: Small disc protrusion at T7-8 with cord
encroachment, but normal signal in the cord. Intervertebral
osteophyte at T8-9 with some cord encroachment. Fracture of the
superior endplate of T10 with gross disruption of the ALL and
slight thoracic lordosis without evidence of cord compression at
T9-10. Findings at T9-10 are consistent with a relatively acute
[**Name (NI) 76574**] fracture.
.
CXR (AP, [**3-1**]): In comparison with study of [**2-28**], diffuse
bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist.  Again this would be
consistent with a widespread aspiration pneumonia on a substrate
of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
.
CXR ([**2130-3-6**])(one day after starting steroids): In comparison
with study of [**2-4**], there has been a substantial decrease in the
opacification in the left perihilar region as well as the upper
and lower zones on the right.
.
TTE ([**2130-3-7**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal for the patient's body size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the anterior, anterolateral, mid to distal
anteroseptum walls and akinesis of the apex. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
35-40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posterioly directed
jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-2-6**], the
left ventricular function has significantly decreased with
regional wall motion abnormality. Moderate mitral regurgitation
is present.
.
Rest Thallium ([**2130-3-10**]): Fixed moderate perfusion defect in the
distal anterior, apical and lateral segments.
.
CHEST PORTABLE AP SEMI-UPRIGHT ([**2130-3-14**]):  The heart is not
enlarged.  The patient's lung volumes are decreased.  An ICD
device has been placed with the leads in the appropriate
position, one lead is over the right atrium and other over the
right ventricle.  In comparison the diffuse bilateral opacities
within the lungs have improved.  The bilateral diffuse opacities
are still present in the upper lobes with the right side greater
than the left.  The ET tube is 4.6 cm from the carina and the
right PICC tube is in the mid SVC.  There are no pleural
effusions and no pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
RHYTHM/CARDIAC ARREST
On arrival, Mr. [**Known lastname 8071**] was placed on the cooling protocol for
cardiac arrest. Preliminary workup did not reveal acute ischemic
coronary process and no ECG changes were noted.  EP was
consulted and the cardiac arrest was thought secondary to
ventricular arrhythmia since peri-code strips showed VT
althought the source was unclear given no known structural heart
disease, no prior history of MI, no CHF symptoms, QTc not
significantly prolonged.  It is possible due to a scar since he
has 3VD adn may have had a silent MI.  Initially family opted
not to have ICD placed and wanted it managed medically (given
poor neurologic status).   He was therefore started on
amiodarone but this was stopped on [**2130-3-7**] after developing
amiodarone induced BOOP with hemoptysis.  At this time, EP was
reconsulted and recommended ICD given that not even amio has
been shown to be useful in secondary prevention of sudden
cardiac death, and especially in the setting of amio- induced
BOOP was ICD indicated. Family and pt agreed given the
neurological improvement of pt.  ICD was placed on [**2130-3-13**], a
dual chamber [**Company 1543**] Virtuoso via cephalic without
complications.  The device was not tested, to have DFT in
3months from the procedure. Also, was [**Company 1988**] for device
clinic on 9am on [**3-21**]. He was [**Month/Year (2) 1988**] for an appointment with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2133-4-13**]:20.  Of note, Twave oversensing at
0.3mV [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 36**] set to 0.45.
Pt also has a hx of parox atrial fibrillation but remained in
NSR throughout the hospital stay after he stabilized from his
arrest although he had occasional ectopy.  Anticoagulation was
held aftetr amiodarone induced BOOP was discovered but restarted
after placement of ICD (coumadin and subq heparin).  For his
afib he continued to be well rate controlled on metoprolol (when
sleeps falls to low 40s but asymptomatic)
.
ISCHEMIA
Cardiac catheterization was performed and revealed severe three
vessel disease. CT surgery was consulted and after evaluation
determined he was not a candidate for CABG due to the severity
of CAD and lack of targets for anastomosis; therefore his
medical management was optimized wtih ACEI, BB, ASA, statin.
Possible intervention was revisited after his significant
neurologic progress at which time a rest MIBI was perform to
explore possible salvagable regions but the study demonstrated a
fixed moderate perfusion defect in the distal anterior, apical
and lateral segments; therefore medical management was
recommended.  Pt should be [**Last Name (un) 1988**] to have an appointment 4
weeks from now to be seen by his primary cardiologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 31624**].
.
PULMONARY EDEMA
Pt had some pulmoary edema seen on CXR as pulm congestion, echo
initally demonstrated EF>55%, then a repeat echo demonstarted EF
35-40% with anterior hypokinesis of the anterior, anterolateral,
mid to distal anteroseptum walls and akinesis of the apex.  Pt
was diuresed with lasix IV.  BB and ACEI as above.  Pt was
started on po lasix prior to d/c with a dose of 20mg daily.
Please titrate this down as tolerated to keep an even I/O
balance as pt appears to be euvolemic at the time of discharge.

.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8071**] was initially intubated as part of the cooling
protocol for cardiac arrest.  He exhibited slow recovery and was
successfuly extubated on [**2130-2-13**]. He continued to have impaired
cognition with dysarthria, however, and was unable to protect
his airway with oral intake.  Video swallow evaluation revealed
aspiration, and he underwent PEG placement on [**2130-2-21**].  There
was concern for ongoing aspiration, as well as possible
occlusion of his airway by his tongue given poor muscle tone
with brain stem injury.  He also required Q30-60 minute deep
suctioning for copious secretions, and the decision was made to
perform a tracheostomy for long-term care.  Tracheostomy was
performed on [**2130-2-23**] without complication.  Mental status
improved intially following tracheostomy.  However, patient had
an episode of agitation overnight requiring antipsychotics and
benzos and then had worsening respiratory status requiring
placement back on the vent. His mental status then cleared but
he still required some minor ventilatory support but was slowly
eaned off to trach mask which he tolerated 24 hrs a day for the
past 4 days.
A repeat speech and swallow evaluation performed on [**3-1**]
recommended holding off PM valve evaluation and swallow
evaluation until patient is on tracheostomy mask and secretions
have decreased. This will need to be readdressed during his
rehab stay as pt is likely very close to being able to swallow
safely.
.
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:
The patient was initially treated with flagyl and unasyn for
aspiration pneumonia throught to have started during his cardiac
arrest.  On [**2130-2-22**], he was noted to have low-grade fever,
increasing secretions, and new CXR opacities concerning for
recurrent aspiration events.  He was started on vancomycin and
zosyn for broadened coverage, and he received a tracheostomy for
improved airway protection and suctioning. His broad spectrum
antibiotics were changed to Augmentin on [**2130-2-24**] with a plan to
complete a 7 day course, finishing [**2130-3-1**].  However, pt
developed bilateral opacifications and fever prompting us to
restart vanc/zosyn and for IR to place PICC given single
peripheral access and anticipating 8 day course of IV abx needed
which were finished on [**2130-3-9**] with pt remaining afebrile and
with some resolution of infiltrates (which in retrospect may
have been caused mostly by amiodarone induced BOOP).  Pt also
had moderate sized pleural effusions that were thought to be
decreasing in size by the time of discharge.  Since pt never
spiked another fever after restarting abx these effusions were
NOT thought to be infected and therefore did not need a tap.
.
AMIODARONE INDUCED BOOP:
On [**2130-2-27**], patient developed hematocrit drop.  CXR showed
worsening alveolar infiltrates and bloody secretions were noted
from his tracheostomy tube. Interventional Pulmonology evaluated
patient with a bronchoscopy and serial BALs showed progressive
hemorrhage consistent with alveolar hemorrhage, thought likely
due to combination of a pneumonia and anticoagulation.  His
lovenox and coumadin were held and he was transfused a total of
three PRBCs. His hematocrit stabilized on [**3-1**] and remained
stable around 30 thereafter.  Pulmonary were consulted who
thought thi was more consistent with amiodarone induced BOOP and
steroid were started on [**2130-3-6**] which dramatic improvement
overnight in symptoms and in findings on CXR with decrease in
bilateral opacification. An appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 575**]
was made for pt to be seen on [**2130-4-10**] at 8:00am.  Please make
sure pt gets to this appt.  he needs to be there for 30 minuted
prior for testing.  In addition, a request to have PFT's were
placed.  Please follow-up with the PFT lab at [**Hospital1 **] for the time
and place for this (requested 4 weeks from today) as well as a
chest x-ray to check for resolution of the amio-induced BOOP.
.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:
Patient had a history of atrial fibrillation and had
intermittent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation over the course of
his admission.  He was intially managed with beta blockade which
was down titrated with addition of amiodarone.  He was continued
on heparin drip throughout for anticoagulation and was
eventually transitioned to lovenox and coumadin following trach
and PEG placement.  Anticoagulation was held in the setting of
alveolar hemorrhage and hematocrit drop and restarted coumadin
and lovenox once the BOOP had completely resolved.
.
T10 VERTEBRAL FRACTURE:
The patient was noted to have fallen during his cardiac arrest,
and abdominal CT revealed an abnormality of the T10 vertebrae.
MRI of the spine showed fracture of the superior endplate of T10
with gross disruption of the ALL without evidence of cord
compression at T9-10.  Neurosurgery was consulted and placed
orthotic lumbo-sacral support device. He is supposed to wear the
brace at all times when out of bed.  A hole was drilled in the
brace to allow his PEG tube to be accessed easily without
removal of the brace.  Pls make an appointment with neurosurgery
to assess for ability to come out of brace once healed from
fracture.  Pls make an appointment to be seen within 2-4 weeks.
.
LEFT DISTAL FIBULA FRACTURE:
Ankle x-ray on [**2130-2-8**] revealed a subacute nondisplaced fracture
of the distal left fibula, thought to have been sustained during
the initial cardiac arrest and fall.  Orthopedic surgery was
consulted and a brace was used to protect the ankle while the
patient was in bed.  He developed severe bullous dermatitis over
his left foot and ankles after wearing the brace for two days,
so it was removed.  Wound care nursing was consulted and lesions
have improved considerably.  He will need to have new fitted
orthotic device on at all times when weight bearing. Follow up
in orthopedic clinic in 4 weeks.
.
MENTAL STATUS
Intially thought to have some level of anoxic brain injury given
30 minutes w/o spontaneous perfusion and GCS of 4 upon arrival
to [**Hospital1 18**] but made tremendous advances and was alert and oriented
x3, moving all extremities but with need for significant
PT/rehab in recovery.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after you were found
unconscious after your heart stopped. You required intensive
support and underwent a special protocol where your body is
cooled in order to help your body deal with this severe event.
After several days, we were able to discontinue ventilator
support and you have continued to improve daily. You have not
been able to protect your airway when you eat or swallow, and a
special feeding tube had to be inserted in order to help you
eat.
You had an ICD placed in order to prevent another cardiac
arrest.
You were treated for aspiration pneumonia and had bleeding into
your lung from amiodarone induced toxicity.  Both were treated
and you have improved steadily.
We also found evidence of a fracture in your left leg and one of
your vertebrae; you will need to wear the special brace we

Date of Birth:   [**2046-10-19**]     Sex:  M

Service:  C-MEDICINE

This dictation covers the patient's hospitalization from
[**2115-3-26**], to [**2115-3-28**], while on the C-Medicine service.
Hospital course from admission through [**2115-3-26**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Vascular Surgery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from Vascular
Surgery to the C-Medicine Service following ICD placement.

1.  Cardiac - ICD was placed without complication.  The
patient was monitored on telemetry without any events of
ventricular tachycardia though occasional premature
ventricular contractions were noted on telemetry.  He was
continued on Amiodarone at 200 mg p.o. once daily. His
Lopressor was continued at the same dose of 50 mg twice a
day.

2.  Congestive heart failure - The patient's Captopril was
titrated from 6.25 mg up to 12.5 mg p.o. three times a day.
He appeared total body volume overloaded and was diuresed
with Lasix, initially intravenous and then changed to 40 mg
p.o. twice a day, with good effect.

3.  Ischemia - He was continued on his Aspirin.

4.  Pulmonary - At the time of transfer, the patient had a
significant oxygen requirement of six liters to maintain an
oxygen saturation of greater than 90%.  Chest x-ray was
repeated which revealed persistent left lower lobe effusion
likely residual from his bypass surgery, as well as
persistent bibasilar atelectasis and prominent pulmonary
vasculature suggesting mild congestive heart failure.  He was
given incentive spirometer and encouraged to use it
frequently which he did.  In addition, he was diuresed with
Lasix as above with good effect.  Physical therapy evaluated
the patient and on ambulation found that his oxygen
saturation dropped to 78% in room air while ambulating on
[**2115-3-26**].  At the time of discharge, the patient has been at
88 to 90% on two liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.  He was
discharged with home oxygen with visiting nurses to assess
his oxygen requirement and wean as tolerated with Lasix at 40
mg p.o. twice a day to be taken for one week and then down to
once daily.

5.  Infectious disease - At the time of transfer, the patient
was on Levofloxacin which had been started prior to the
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.  This was discontinued
after completion of a seven day course.  His interval urinary
tract infection appears to have cleared as a culture drawn on
[**2115-3-25**], had no growth at the time of this dictation.  He
was given periprocedural antibiotics for his ICD placement,
initially Cefazolin intravenously, however, the patient lost
peripheral access and was changed to Keflex p.o. which he
will continue to take four days following discharge.

6.  Endocrine - The patient's blood sugar has been running a
bit high and the patient was on insulin sliding scale.  The
patient did not have a history of diabetes mellitus and at
the time of transfer, his blood sugar was well within the
normal range.  It is likely his blood sugar was running on
the high side due to a stress response from the multitude of
procedures that the patient had undergone.  His insulin
sliding scale was discontinued and his blood sugar remained
normal.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. three times a day.
4.  Keflex 500 mg p.o. q6hours to end on [**2115-3-31**].
5.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. twice a day for one week and then once
daily thereafter.
7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
8.  Dulcolax 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. constipation.
9.  Lactulose 30 ccs three times a day p.r.n. constipation.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient has a follow-up appointment to see
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Device Clinic on [**2115-4-3**], at 2:30 p.m.  He
is to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31998**] to make an appointment
to be seen in two weeks in follow-up.  Finally, he is to call
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 28544**], to make an appointment to be
seen four weeks following discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ventricular tachycardia, status post ablation and ICD
placement.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction and three vessel coronary artery bypass graft.
3.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm, status post endovascular
repair.
4.  Urinary tract infection.

ADDENDUM:  Hospital course starting when Vascular Surgery got
involved.

The Vascular Surgery Team was consulted on this patient on
[**2115-3-12**] secondary to an incidental finding of
abdominal aortic aneurysm upon cardiac catheterization.  The
patient had been admitted to the [**Hospital3 **] on the
Cardiology Service secondary to chest pain and ventricular
tachycardia.  A CTA was performed showing a 9 cm AAA.

The patient was taken to the OR by the Cardiac Surgery
Service on [**2115-3-13**] and had a coronary artery bypass
graft times three performed.  With the risk of rupture of a 9
cm AAA, it was felt that repair of the AAA should be
performed as soon as possible after the CABG since an open
AAA following a CABG has a very high morbidity.  It was
decided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the patient to perform an
endovascular stent graft.

The patient was taken to the OR on [**2115-3-21**], where an
endovascular AAA repair was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] under
general anesthesia with an estimated blood loss of 500 cc.
No complications.  The patient was taken to the PACU in
stable condition.  Intraoperatively, the patient received 4.5
units of LR, 2 units of packed red blood cells and had a
urine output of 2,000 cc.  He was kept intubated and was
transferred to the SICU on propofol and nitroglycerin drip.

Postoperatively, the patient had persistent hypoxemia
requiring FI02 of 100%.  The patient was on SIMV with
pressure support of 5, PEEP 12.5, and 100% 02.  Blood gas of
7.46, 35, 67, 26, 1, and 95%.  The chest x-ray only revealed
mild atelectasis at the bases bilaterally.

The patient was extubated on postoperative day number one
without events.  On postoperative day number two, the
hematocrit came back at 26.8 and the patient was transfused 1
unit of packed red blood cells with a Lasix chaser.  The
patient had a clear diet on postoperative day number two and
advanced to a full diet by postoperative day number three.

The patient's 02 saturations on postoperative day number
three were 94-95% on 6 liters nasal cannula.  Vancomycin and
levofloxacin were started perioperatively and were continued
postoperatively.  The levofloxacin was started because of a
U/A that had positive nitrite and micro had many bacteria.
The vancomycin was started when his urine culture grew
Enterococcus.

The patient was transferred to the VICU on postoperative day
number three.  The patient continued to do well with the 02
saturations still in the mid 90s on 6 liters nasal cannula.
The patient was receiving Lasix for diuresis as the patient
was positive many liters after his AAA repair.  The patient
was stable at this point from the vascular point of view and
Cardiology suggested the placement of an ICD.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiology Service after
the ICD was placed on [**2115-3-26**].  The Cardiology Service will
be dictating the hospital stay from [**2115-3-26**] to discharge.

  - RCA lesion was stented
  - RA 8, RV 24/7, PA 24/14, PCWP 16, CO 3.30 (Fick), CI 2.23

Echo: [**2126-5-20**]
 The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
 normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Resting
regional wall
 motion abnormalities include inferior, septal and apical
hypokinesis (views suboptimal). Left ventricular ejection
fraction ?45%. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo man with hypercholeterolemia s/p inferior STEMI and s/p
ventricular fibrillation arrest in ED converted to NSR.

1) CAD - Cardiac catheterization revealed severe 3 Vessel
Disease with thrombus in the RCA that was stented. He was on
integrillen for 18 hours post cath. He was started on aspirin,
plavix, lopressor, lipitor. He should remain on plavix for at
least 6 months. He would benefit from an ACE inhibitor to be
started as an outpatient. We did not start it here because his
blood pressure was somewhat low. We recommend further
revascularization either by CABG or PCI in the future. If his
anterior wall function is preserved he may have increased
benefit from CABG. It may be advisable to wait a few months to
allow the RCA stent to heal and ensure there is no acute
stenosis before taking him for CABG. We recommend repeat echo to
determine his anterior wall function.

2) Hypercholesterolemia: He was started on lipitor 80 mg QD. He
should have CK and liver function tests in 6 weeks.

3) Rhythm: Ventricular fibrillation arrest in setting of acute
inferior MI. He was shocked in the ER with return to NSR. He had
a few episodes of NSVT on telemtry which is to be expected post
MI. He does not need to have an ICD placed given the MI likely
caused his ventricular fibrillation.

4) Cardiac function: Echo on [**5-21**] after catheterization with EF
of ~45%. He also had hypokinesis of apex, septum, and inferior
wall. He does not need anticoagulation given his preserved EF.

5) Anemia - His hematocrit dropped during his hospital course.
He stabilized at 30.  CT scan was obtained without evidence of
retroperitoneal bleed. We think he was dehydrated on admission
and now equilibrating.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old male with PMH significant for CAD
with 2 prior bypass surgeries and 2 PCIs, PAD s/p carotid
stenting and per patient b/l LE bypass, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, chronic stable angina who presented with a VF
arrest.

His wife describes that the patient was awoken by tooth pain
overnight yesterday that did not resolve with Percocet or
Ambien; she adds that he has had difficulty sleeping for the
past 2 weeks due to increasing chest discomfort at rest. The
patient also has had palpitations and SOB with exertion that
seemed to be worsening over the past 4-6 weeks. The patient also
describes occasional L arm pain in shoulder. One month ago he
had a exercise stress test at [**Hospital1 3278**] to evaluate these worsening
symptoms- this showed poor exercise toleranace and so the
patient underwent diagnostic cath showing patent CABG grafts,
patent stents, no new occlusions. Of note, the patient stopped
taking Ranexa two weeks ago because of diarrhea side effects; he
associates his worsening symptoms with this. He has extensive
CAD and vascular history as outlined below but has no history of
arrythmis or syncope.

Today, the patient experienced his chronic anginal chest pain
while walking to the board of directors meeting for the
hospital. During the meeting, the patient became unresponsive
and was found to be pulseless; CPR was initiated and the patient
was intubated.  Cardiac monitoring demonstrated VF and a 360J
shock was delivered, and chest compressions were continued.  The
patient immediately returned to a normal perfusing rhythm, and
was extubated.

He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient
was complaining of [**7-24**] sub-sternal chest pain, EKG showed
depressions in I, II, III, aVF, V4-V6. Patient was given ASA and
a bolus of lidocaine. Underwent catheterization which
demonstrated patent stents and LIMA and prominent severe AR.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the CCU after going into cardiac arrest.
 Prior to arrival to CCU, a code STEMI was called and patient
underwent cardiac catheterization.  Prior grafts and stents were
patent and now new coronary lesions were found.  Patient
remained hemodynamically stable and was alert and oriented after
the procedure.  While in the CCU, he was monitored closely.  He
denied any further episodes of angina, shortness of breath, or
palpitations.  He was started on metoprolol 12.5mg TID and
continued on his other home medications including aggrenox,
rousvastatin, valsartan and plavix.  His chest pain was
attributed to compression and was controlled with percocet and a
lidocaine patch.  Follow-up EKG's did not show any new ST
changes.  Post-cath check was normal and he did well overnight.
He underwent a head CT which did not show any acute intracranial
pathology or evidence of hypoxic ischemic injury.

He is being transferred to [**Hospital 3278**] Medical Center as his primary
cardiologist, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14714**], is based there.  He will need an

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76 year old male with a history of CAD s/p
CABG, HTN, AF, syncope s/p PPM who presents following
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The patient has been noted to be
slightly dysnpic over the last two days. He has not experienceid
any chest pain, palpitations, light-headnedness, or any other
symtpoms. On the day of presenation, the patient went out to do
errands. He had spoken to his wife pulling into a wall-mart
parking lot, and did not make any notable complaints. He was
found down in the parking lot unresponsive. The event was
unwitnessed. Security was called, who placed an AED on the
patient, and fired twice for a shockable rhythm. EMS was
activated. From being found down to confirmation of a purfusing
rhythm, the estimated time down is roughly ten minutes.
He was intubated in the field and transfered to [**Hospital3 6592**].

While there, the patient was noted to be hemodynapically stable.
A CT scan of the head and neck were performed, and reportadly
normal. The patients wife says that at [**Name (NI) **] the patient was
squeezing hands on command and was intially grabing at lines
with purposeful movement of all for extremities. He was
emergently transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for futher evaluation and care.
.
In the ED, the patient's HR was 72, BP 137/74, satting 100% on
the ventillator. He was give IV versed for sedation. He was
noted to have BRB in the anal vault. The patient was transfered
to the CCU for further care.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, or presyncope

Studies/Imaging:
.
CXR [**11-28**] -
FINDINGS: Single AP chest radiograph without comparison shows ET
tube
terminating 3.6 cm above the carina. The lungs are clear. The
heart is
moderately enlarged. The patient is status post median
sternotomy and CABG.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. NG-tube is in
satisfactory
position with tip in the stomach. Leads of a right-sided
pacemaker terminate
in the right atrium and ventricle. Surgical staple overlies the
left upper
abdomen.

IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pneumonia
or overt CHF.
.
CTA [**11-28**] -
IMPRESSION:

1. No pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.

2. Small-to-moderate bibasilar consolidation with aspiration
favored over
pneumonia.

3. Small amount of secretions surrounding the proximally
visualized
endotracheal tube.

4. Dilated ascending thoracic aorta
.
ECHO [**11-28**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral and basal inferoseptal
akinesis (likely RCA territory). There is moerate to severe
hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 15-20%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are three
moderately thickened aortic leaflets, with poor excursion.
Two-dimensional imaging suggests significant aortic stenosis,
but its severity cannot be reliably quantified given low LV
stroke volume. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe regional and global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, suggestive of a global process (toxic, metabolic,
etc.) on a background of prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Significant aortic
stenosis. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension. Dilated thoracic aorta.
.
ECHO [**12-8**]:
.
The left atrium is dilated. There is an inferobasal left
ventricular aneurysm. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior,
inferolateral segments. The other segments are moderately
hypokinetic. There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at
rest or with Valsalva. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not
quantified as LV systolic function is significantly impaired).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-11-29**],
the inferior and inferolateral akinesis persists. The other
segments have slightly better function. The other findings -
aortic stenosis, mild mitral and at least moderate tricuspid
regurgitation - are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who
presented with cardiac arrest, intubated and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
# SEPSIS.  Sources included VAP and line related infection.  On
[**11-30**], pt was found to be febrile with SBPs below 90mmHg, and RR
20-30s.  BCx from R femoral line placed on [**12-1**] (no neck access
due to neck collar) grew Pseudomonas A.  He remained hypotensive
and required pressor support with Dopamine and Levophed.
Patient also had also developed bilateral opacities on CXR,
thick and bloody secretions.  His sputum [**12-1**] and [**12-2**] grew
MSSA and Enterobactericae.  UA and UCx were negative, there was
no diarrhea.  R femoral line was removed on [**12-3**].  He was
started on Zosyn and Vancomycin on [**12-1**] and pt intially
defervesced on this regimen, however next day became febrile
again.  Tobramycin was added for initially unknown GNR coverage
in sputum.  Once Cx from sputum and perphery were finalized, ABx
regimen was changed to nafcicillin IV and ciprofloxacin for a
total treatment length of 14 days.  His dopamine was weaned on
[**12-2**], while levophed was weaned on [**12-6**].  Pt. was successfully
extubated on [**12-6**]. He remained afebrile until discharge.  Since
patient developed worsening renal failure on [**12-8**], which was
felt to be consistent w/ AIN, his nafcillin was changed to
cefazolin IV.   He has completed that course.  He is still due
to complete the 14 day course of cipro, and is currently on day
10 of 14.
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Pt. was intubated on transfer.  Most
likely felt to be [**1-18**] possible volume overload and VAP (see
above).  He was initially afebrile and euvolemi on exam, but
required volume resuscitation due to hypotension developed on
HD#2. Initial CXRs did not show vascular congestion or
consolidation, however pt became febrile on [**11-30**] and was found
to have b/l lower lobe opacities.  He was started on treatment
for VAP.  ABGs were consistent w/ mixed respiratory alkalosis
and metabolic alkalosis, likely [**1-18**] sepsis and possible CNS
injury. PaO2/FiO2 min was 214.  By [**12-6**] pH and CO2 normlaized,
CNS status improved significantly and patient was successfully
extubated. Pt. continued to have mild wheezing on exam, treated
w/ albuterol nebs prn.  He has since been oxygenating well on
room air, and has not required additional nebulizer treatments.
.
# CORONARIES: Patient with history of CAD, s/p CABG. No ischemic
changes on EKG, although limited to interpret with V pacing. CKs
peaked at 269, MB at 15 w/ index 8.9 and normalized by HD#1.  It
was felt that CK elevations were due to fall and possible VF
that lead to cardiac arrest.  This event was not believed to be
ischemic in nature.  Patient was continued on ASA, beta-blocker
and ACE were held due to septic shock.  LDL was 49 and HbA1C was
6.2.  Patient was continued on simvastatin.  Low dose metoprolol
was restarted on [**12-7**] once BP tolerated.  Lisinopril was held
due to worsening RF, but has since been restarted.
.
# PUMP.  Patient w/ known history of CHF, systolic likely [**1-18**]
CAD.  Last EF of 30-35% on ECHO as outpatient in [**2194-6-17**].
Patient was noted to have EF of 15-20%, severe regional and
global left ventricular systolic dysfunction on a background of
prior inferior myocardial infarction  (akinesis). Mild right
ventricular systolic dysfunction was also noted.  Pt had
significant AS, moderate TR and mild PAH.  As patient was volume
resuscitated for septick shock, he became volume overloaded
evident w/ peripheral edema and vascular congestion on CXR.  As
sepsis was controlled and patient was extubated, he was started
on low dose lasix with moderate effect.  On [**12-7**] patient was
started on Spironolactone 25mg QD which was subsequently d/ced
due to worsening renal failure.  A repeat ECHO on [**12-8**] showed
mild improvement in EF 20-25%, new L inferobasal aneurysm, and
inferior and infrelolateral akinesis persisting w/ prior
findings.
  Given akinesis of inferior wall and atrial fibrillation,
patient was started on heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin.
 Patient will require follow up ECHO and cardiology appt in one
month to assess for ICD placment.  He will have his repeat TTE
in [**1-19**] weeks, and see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic for evaluation of
possible CRT/d.
.
# RHYTHM:  Hx of chronic Afib.  PPM interrogations showed
episodes of VT, followed VF prior to cardiac arrest.  Patient
received 2 shocks from AED. Throughout hospitalization patient
was in atrial fibrillation w/ v-pacing 40 - 60% of the time.  He
was restarted on coumadin as well as started on amiodarone 400mg
[**Hospital1 **] for cardioversion on [**12-8**] to augment CO w/ atrial kick.
Cardioversion with biphasic 200J and 300J was attempted with
patient remaining in atrial fibrillation.  The patient is being
continued at amioderone 400mg daily, and will have a second
attempt at cardioversion in [**1-19**] weeks.  He will also see Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic in [**2-18**] weeks for ICD placement versus CRT/d.
.
# CARDIAC ARREST.   Based on records, it appears he was in VF
for up to 6 minutes and it is unclear how long patient remained
w/o rhythm.  During this time, he received two DCCV but it is
not entirely clear if he was receiving chest compressions as
well.  He was intubated in the field.  Pt was unresponsive on
admission.  No initial neurological exam off sedation was
performed at OSH.  In [**Name (NI) **] pt had ""absent corneal reflexes but
opened eyes to name.""  CT head at OSH was wnl.  Patient
underwent 24 hours of cooling to 34C per Artic sun cooling
protocol.  Repeat at [**Hospital1 18**] did not show ICH or infarction.  Exam
at 72h off sedation showed eyes opening to command, intact
corneal and pupillary reflexes, spontaneous extermities
movements and flexor withdrawal to pain, all consistent w/ ~ 50%
meaningful neurological recovery.  Neurology team was consulted
and followed patient throughout the stay.  On [**12-6**] patient was
following simple commands, responding to yes/no questions with
improving strength in all extremities.  He was extubated on
[**12-6**].  His neurological status improved, orientation (A&Ox3).
Patient with generalized weakness, but no focal deficit.  Given
previous cardiac arrest and EF ~ 20-25% patient is to undergo a
1mo follow up ECHO with further evaluation for ICD placement
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# HTN.  Patient was hypotensive in shock during early stages of
hospitalization.  Once shock resolved, patient was restarted on
low dose BBk, ACE, and spironolactone.
.
# BG management. Pt initially w/ FS consistently > 200.  No
known history of diabetes, w/ HbA1C of 6.2.  He was maintained
on TF while intubated.  His BG was consistently elevated and he
was on Lantus and ISS.  His lantus had to be uptitrated to
18units daily.  This regimen will be continued while in rehab,
but should be switched to metformin in coordination with his
PCP, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41710**].
.
# ANEMIA.  Normocytic, hypoproliferative. HCT on admission of
35, dropping to 22.  HCT on discharge was 25.  This was felt to
be due to combination of ACD and dilutional effects from fluid
administaration (at HCT nadir, pt was 7.8L positive).  Fe
studies were consistent w/ ACD.  Haptoglobin was nl, as were
TSH, B12 and Folate. The patient was started on iron, folate,
and pyridoxime supplementation.
.
# RENAL FAILURE.  Baseline unknown.  Cr. on admission was 1.3
and fluctuated between 1.4 and 0.8 during cooling and sepsis.
On [**12-7**] Cr increased to 1.6 with diuresis and aldactone and
rose to maximum of 2.1.  This was felt to be most likely [**1-18**]
pre-renal etiology and AIN given FEUrea of 37% and WBC
cast/eosinophilia on UA.  Patient's nafcillin was switched to
cefazolin on [**12-8**].  At time of discharge, Cr was improved to
1.5.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Cardiac arrest, sepsis, pneumonia, acute renal failure
Secondary: coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, chronic atrial fibrillation


Discharge Condition:
Hemodynamically stable, afebrile.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with cardiac arrest.  To help treat
this event, you required intubation and a cooling procedure to
maintain your brain function.  Your course was complicated by
sepsis (severe infection in your blood and other orgains).  You
required treatment with multiple intravenous antibiotics and
medications to maintain your blood pressure.

With these treatments your condition improved significantly.
You were extubated and your mental functioning improved
significantly.

Your course was also complicated by worsening heart failurek,
kidney failure and atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rate in
your atrium).  You underwent a cardioversion procedure for
atrial fibrillation which was unsuccessful.  Your heart failure
and your kidney failure are much improved at time of discharge.
You will need to complete a 14 day course of ciprofloxacin to
treat your blood infection.  You are being discharged to rehab.
We will plan a second attempt at cardioversion in [**1-19**] weeks, and
you will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic for evaluation of an ICD in
[**2-18**] weeks.

Your medication regimen was also changed significantly from the
medications you were taking at home.  Please review the list
provided below and take the medications as prescribed.

It was felt that your cardiac arrest was likely due to a
dangerous arrhythmia, vetricular fibrillation (irregular heart
beat of your ventricle).  For this reason, you will require a
close follow up with your cardiologist and an additional
evaluation for a defibrillator, once your heart failure is
stable.

Should you experience worsening shortness of breath, chest pain,
sweats, palpitations, cough, fevers, chills, nausea, or any
other symptom concerning to you, please call the rehabilitation
facility doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.

Please follow up with your appointments as listed below.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] and Neurologist.

You have a follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2193-12-28**] at 1:20pm in
the [**Location (un) 8661**] Building of the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] of [**Hospital1 18**] on the [**Location (un) 3971**].

You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] to set up a second attempt at
cardioversion and follow up echocardiogram planned for [**1-19**]
weeks.  If you do not hear in week, please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] and
ask for Jassen [**Doctor Last Name 7086**].

You had requested a referral for a cardiologist.  You could see

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 41711**], [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 41712**]

Date of Birth:   [**2046-10-19**]       Sex:  M

Service:

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Myocardial infarction.
2.  Ventricular tachycardia.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
male who was taking his garbage out to the curb when he had
the sudden onset of severe chest pain associated with
diaphoresis and shortness of breath.  It was described as
similar to chest pain he had during a CHF exacerbation at
[**Hospital1 18**] in [**2112-7-14**].  The patient contact[**Name (NI) **] the EMS System
who found him in ventricular tachycardia and he was
cardioverted in the field to sinus and brought in and
referred to an outside hospital.  There, he was given
aspirin, Lopresor, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post MI in his 30s.
2.  Status post cardiac catheterization with LAD stenting in
[**2112**].
3.  Ejection fraction 23%.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin q.d.
2.  Toprol XL 50 mg q.d.
3.  Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
4.  Cozaar 25 mg q.d.
5.  Lasix 20 mg q.d.
6.  Coenzyme Q.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate
69, blood pressure 110/62, respirations 14, saturations 96%.
General:  The patient was in no acute distress.  HEENT:
EOMI.  PERRL, anicteric.  The throat was clear.  Chest:
There were coarse breath sounds bilaterally with right
greater than left.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm
without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, without masses or organomegaly.
Extremities:  Warm, noncyanotic, nonedematous times four.
Neurological:  Grossly intact.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  CBC 7.8/42.5/111.  Chemistries:
136/4.0/97/28/12/1.2/288.  CKs 154 with an MB of 14.9 and
troponin of 9.4.

The chest x-ray showed only mild atelectasis at the right
lower lobe, no acute CHF picture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially on a lidocaine
drip for his ventricular tachycardia.  He was admitted to the
ICU for close monitoring.  On hospital day number two, the
patient was transferred down to the floor.  At that time, he
was stabilized in preparation for cardiac catheterization and
possible ablation.   The patient did rule in for an MI,
although there were no ST elevations detected on the EKG.

The Electrophysiology Service was consulted in regards to his
episode of ventricular tachycardia.  VT ablation versus ICD
were discussed and both were possibilities.  Catheterization
was performed on [**2115-3-11**] which revealed an ejection fraction
of 20%, as well as diffuse disease of a right dominant
system.  It was felt that the patient would benefit from
revascularization.  It was also noted that the patient had a
very large abdominal aortic aneurysm greater than 7 cm at
this time.  The patient was recommended further delineation
of CT angiography for sizing of the aorta as well as possible
endostenting.

The patient went for VT ablation later that day.  The patient
continued, however, to have an episode of ventricular
tachycardia postprocedure.  It was asymptomatic and identical
to the episode described three days prior.

Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted for the patient's three
vessel disease.  Vascular Surgery was also consulted for his
large AAA.  The patient underwent CABG times three on
[**2115-3-13**] with LIMA to diagonal artery, saphenous vein graft
to LAD and acute marginal.

Postoperatively, the patient was taken to CRSU for closer
monitoring.  It was complicated only by having to reopen to
remove a lap pad.  The patient was extubated on the evening
of postoperative day number zero and tolerated this well.  He
continued to have recurrent ventricular tachycardia status
post ablation and the patient remained A-paced using
temporary pacing wires.  The patient also had multiple
episodes of NSVT and Amiodarone bolus was given as well as
Amiodarone drip.

The patient had recurrent prolonged runs of NSVT on
postoperative day number two and the EP Service continued to
follow.  It was felt with the patient's multiple arrhythmias
the patient would most likely benefit from implantation of an
AICD.  The patient was transitioned to p.o. Amiodarone which
did not seem to be as effective as a drip.  He was restarted
on the Amiodarone drip.

On postoperative day number three, the patient's chest tubes
were removed and the insulin drip was weaned to off.
Physical Therapy began seeing the patient.  The patient did
begin ambulating some.  The patient's Cordis was changed over
a wire to a lumen CVL on postoperative day number five.

By postoperative day number five, the patient was seen to be
stable overnight and the patient was transferred to the
floor.  On the floor, the patient had a largely unremarkable
course and was preopped appropriately for the Vascular
Service.

The rest of this dictation summary will be completed either
by Vascular Surgery or the other subsequent services to have
this patient.

Chief Complaint:
VF arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Cardiac catheterization revealing minimal coronary lesions
-ICD placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 year old female with history of seasonal allergies
and sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis who presented to the ED
after an out of hospital VF cardiac arrest.  Per report, she was
at work at BU on the day of admission when she collapsed at
approximately 9:15am. A co-worker says that she was seated at
her desk typing and simply slumped over without an obvious
prodrome.  A co-worker started CPR and after the police arrived
on scene they continued CPR and shocked the patient once with an
AED.  When EMS arrived the patient was in VF and required a
total of four shocks before regaining pulse.  There was
approximately fifteen minutes between the time of collapse and
the time pulse was restored per the outside observers.  She was
hypotensive in the field and so was started on dopamine.  Due to
a difficult airway she could not be intubated in the field and
was ventilated with bag valve mask until arrival at the ED.

In the ED the patient was intubated with
etomidate/succinylcholine and after dopamine was stopped she
received amiodarone, ASA PR, and NaHCO3.  Her vitals at that
time were HR 88 and NSR, BP 122/59, RR 19, and O2 Sat of 99% on
100% bag valve mask. She proceeded immediately to the cath lab
where left heart cath showed minimal atherosclerotic disease
without thrombus but with catheter-induced spasm of the proximal
RCA.  Right heart catheterization showed elevated right and left
filling pressures.

Past Medical History:
- sigmoid diverticulitis s/p sigmoidectomy
- appendectomy
- seasonal allergies

Social History:
She does not drink or use alcohol.  She works for BU in
continuing education.  She denies illicit drug use.  She lives
in [**Location (un) **] with her husband.

COMMENTS:
  1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
system
revealed no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary
artery
disease. The LMCA had minimal plaquing. The LAD was patent with
a large
D1 and D2. The distal LAD was tortuous. The LCX had a modest
sized AV
groove giving off tiny OMs and a modest sized high LPL.
Canulation of
the RCA induced vasospasm which was only partially reversed by
intracoronary nitroglycerin injection; mild ostial plaquing
could not be
differentiated from continued vasospasm under these
circumstances. The
RCA gave off a tortuous RPDA with a large RPL-1 and modestly
sized RPL2
and RPL3.
  2. Resting hemodynamics at entry revealed moderately elevated
left
ventricular filling pressures measured at 20 mmHg.
  3. Post-angiography hemodynamics showed mild-moderate
pulmonary
arterial hypertension at 50/233 mmHg. A moderate elevation of
right
atrial at 20 mmHg and capillary wedge pressure at 20 mmHg was
noted.
Cardiac index was high at 4.2 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen
consumption). There was no oxymetric evidence of significant
intracardiac shunting.
  4. Left ventriculography was not performed.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries were free of angiographically-apparent
flow-limiting stenoses.
2. Moderate left and moderate-severe right ventricular diastolic
heart
failure.
3. Mild-moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. No oxymetric evidence of significant intracardiac shunting

[**9-2**] TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Non-Contrast CT Head:
Technically limited study. No evidence for acute intracranial
process.

Cardiac MRI on [**2137-9-5**]: These results were pending at time of
discharge
Impression:
1. Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity size with normal
regional left
ventricular systolic function. The LVEF was normal at 63%. The
effective
forward LVEF was normal at 57%. No CMR evidence of prior
myocardial
scarring/infarction.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
The RVEF was
normal at 66%. No CMR evidence of right ventricular fatty
infiltration/dysplasia.
3. Mild mitral regurgitation. No significant aortic, pulmonic,
or tricuspid
regurgitation.
4. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were
normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter index was normal.
5. Small right pleural effusion


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 53 year old female with past medical history
significant only for seasonal allergies and diverticulitis s/p
partial colectomy presents after out of hospital witnessed VF
arrest.

1.) VF/Rhythm: The patient had an out of hospital VF arrest with
CPR begun almost immediately.  Per report she was shocked four
times prior to having pulses restored.  She was started on
dopamine for hypotension in the field.  On arrival in the ED she
was intubated and dopamine was stopped as her hypotension had
resolved.  She also received amiodarone and aspirin before
tranfer to the cath lab where cardiac catheterization revealed
basically unremarkable coronary arteries.  After cath she was
transferred to the CCU where she was started on an amiodarone
drip as well as heparin drip due to concern about a new RBBB
pattern with possible S1Q3T3 pattern on EKG raised concern for
acute PE.  There were no clear signs of of long QT syndrome or
another ectopic trigger for VF on the EKG.  TTE on the day of
admission showed EF 25% with biventricular hypokinesis, normal
valves, and normal septal thickness but no signs of right heart
strain.  Thus pulmonary embolus was considered a much less
likely etiology of arrest and heparin was stopped on the morning
after admission.  Amiodarone was also eventually stopped as the
patient remained without arrythmias on constant telemetry
marking.  On presentation the patient had been started on a
cooling protocol, which was stopped shortly after her arrival in
the CCU as she had not reached goal temperature in the
appropriate time window and was minimally sedated and quite
active.  No clear trigger for her VF was discovered in the
hospital though underlying cardiomyopathy given her decreased EF
was considered the most likely etiology.   There was also some
concern that the patient's loratidine may have been
arrythmogenic as this is a rare side effect of antihistamines,
and thus she was instructed to no longer take this.  Given the
patient had an out of hospital VF arrest without a clear cause
the electrophysiology service was consulted and placed an ICD
without complication on [**2137-9-5**].  She received three days of
antibiotic prophylaxis (one of vancomycin, two of levofloxacin)
for this procedure.  Cardiac MRI was also obtained to look for
an arrythmogenic scar or ARVD, but the results of this study
weren't available at discharge.   The patient will follow up
with cardiology to discuss the results of this study.

2) Coronary artery disease: The patient had a cardiac
catheterization soon after arrival, which showed no flow
limiting coronary artery disease.  Thus, ACS was considered to
be quite unlikely as a cause of her arrest.  She was put on low
dose daily aspirin during this hospitalization for primary
prevention of ACS given her  cardiomyopathy and the danger of
further insults.

3) Pump: TTE done shortly after arrest showed global LV
dysfunction but no major structual abnormalities or local
injury.  EF was estimated at 25%.  As noted above, cardiac
catheterization showed no significant disease basically
eliminating ischemic cardiomyopathy as a possibility.  The most
common metabolic cardiomyopathies were ruled out by normal TSH
and iron studies and syphillis, though always thought unlikely,
was basically excluded with negative RPR.   The patient has no
history of alcoholism or other toxic exposures that could cause
this profound level of cardiomyopathy.  The patient never had a
clear viral prodrome with fevers, chills, or sore throat, but at
time of discharge the main differential for her depressed pump
function was viral/idiopathic cardiomyopathy vs myocardial
stunning from brief ischemia during her arrest.   The patient
repeatedly denied any signs of cardiomyopathy prior to admission
particularly denying decreased exercise tolerance, lower
extremity edema, and dyspnea and she was never noted to have
these symptoms in her hospital.  The patient did have a cardiac
MRI to evaluate for subtle structural disease, but the results
of this study were still pending at the time of discharge.  The
patient was started on aspirin, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor
prior to discharge for management of her cardiomyopathy; these
were titrated to the maximal dose tolerated.  The patient will
follow-up in cardiology for the results of her MRI as well as
repeat echocardiograms and further management of her cardiac
disease.

4) Neurological status: On presentation in the ED the patient
was started on a cooling protocol for out of hospital cardiac
arrest given her low GCS.  She also had a CT head without
contrast to evaluate for acute intracranial process given the
lack of a clear etiology for her collapse and concern for an
acute intracranial hemorrhage.  CT was negative for acute
intracranial process.  Soon after her CT scan, the patient
became considerably more active and began following some
commands and moving all her extremities vigorously.  As she was
quite agitated and pulling at her endotracheal tube; however,
she received further sedation for her safety.  On the morning
after presentation the team planned to extubate the patient, but
during a spell of agitation she managed to self extubate with no
notable ill effects.  Almost immediately after extubation the
patient was recognizing family members and able to speak with
the treating team, though she had no memory of the events
leading to her hospitalization and would repeatedly forget
conversations from earlier in the day.  By the second day after
admission the patient was consistently oriented to person,
place, time, and situation and able to discuss her health care
in a reasonable and insightful manner.  By the time of discharge
she was considered to be at her baseline with no detected
persistent neurological deficits from her cardiac arrest.

5) Gastrointestinal bleeding: On the morning after admission the
patient had hemoccult positive emesis  in the setting of
supratherapeutic heparin and heaving from the ETT. She was
placed on [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI therapy and overnight on first night in the
hospital her Hct dropped from 43 to 34, but this was also in the
context of receiving a great deal of fluid.  Her heparin was
discontinued as described above and her endotracheal tube
removed.   Repeat emesis was less notably bloody and after a
small further drop on the day after admission serial hematocrits
rematined stable around 30.  Given anemia her vitamin B12 and
folate levels were checked and were normal though her
reticulocyte index was mildly decreased.  The reason for the
inadequate retculocyte index was unclear though possible insult
to the bone marrow during her hypotensive period was considered.


6) Renal: On admission catheterized urine specimen revealed
increased RBC and WBC counts with moderate bacteria.  She was
empirically started on ciprofloxacin until repeat UA was benign
and initial culture was negative.  The results of the first UA
were attributed to trauma, antibiotics were discontinued, and
there were no further renal issues during this hospitalization.

The patient was fed a cardiac/heart healthy diet after regaining
consciousness and being extubated.  She was on PPI for GI
prophylaxis.  She received heparin IV then subcutaneously for
DVT prophylaxis.  She was full code.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Ventricular Fibrillation with Arrest

Discharge Condition:
Stable

Discharge Instructions:
You had a ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. It is unclear
why you had this dangerous heart rhythm.  We did tests that
showed your heart is weak, but it is unclear if this caused your
cardiac arrest or is simply a result of poor blood flow to the
heart during the arrest.  In the hospital you had a
defibrillator placed to shock your heart back into a good rhythm
if this should happen again.  You have also been started on
medications to help protect your heart while it is in its
weakened state.

Your new medications are-
-Metoprolol Succinate: to slow your heart rate down so it can
pump more blood
-Lisinopril: to decrease your blood pressure and make it easier
for your heart to pump.
-Aspirin: a mild blood thinner to prevent blood clots
-Tylenol: for pain because of the ICD placement
-Oxycodone: a narcotic to take if the tylenol doesn't work. This
can make you constipated.
-Your antihistamine (claritin or allergra) was discontinued due
to possible arrhythmia inducing effects.
.
You had an internal defibrillator placed that will deliver a
shock if you have another episode of ventricular fibrillation.
You will need to limit your activity for the next few weeks to
prevent the leads of the pacemaker from becoming displaced in
your heart.  Please don't take a shower for one week and do not
lift more than 5 pounds for 5-6 weeks. Please see the discharge
sheet for more specific instructions.
You have an appointment with your PCP and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] new cardiologist
recommended by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6984**]. Please keep all your appointments as
scheduled.
.
Please weigh yourself every day in the morning before breakfast
and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6984**] if you gain more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 6
pounds in 3 days. Please also call your doctor if you have
trouble lying flat or develop increased shortness of breath.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6984**] if you get a shock from your ICD.  Also
call your doctor or come to the emergency room if you have
sudden development of shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers,
or any other concerning changes in your health.

RIJ


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 61404**] is a 53 year old with a PMH significant for DM, HTN,
a-fib with LV thrombus on coumadin, PHTN and non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy and CHF with an EF of 15% from [**2133-6-26**], s/p cath
in [**8-/2132**] that showed 80% occlusion in RCA who presented to
clinic today with 2 days of chest pain to [**3-7**] with associated
cough but no shortness of breath. His pain was not associated
with exertion as he has been pretty sedentary at home because of
his condition. He has no energy and is unable to do much over
the last few months. At his PCPs office, he was feeling unwell,
with constant non-radiating chest pain that was centrally
located and persistent. He had not taken any medications at the
time of the appointment. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] checked an EKG that showed a
rate of 138, that was interpreted as sinus tachycardia with no
signs of ischemia. He was given a nitroglycerin tab, which
resolved his chest pain, as well as a chewable aspirin. He was
supposed to get 25mg of lopressor in the office, but Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was
unsure if he got it prior to transfer.
.
On transfer to the ED, EMS was concerned for STEMI with ST
elevations in lead V4 on transport, however, the initial EKG in
the ED showed tachycardia with ST depressions in V6. Initial
vitals were HR 133, BP 101/71, RR 28, SaO2 100% RA, T 96.5. His
rate was in the 130s and EKGs showed possible a-flutter. He had
persistent chest pain with nausea and vomiting in the ED. He was
given 1 tab of nitro and lopressor 5mg IV x2. His SBP dropped to
the 60's and he became unresponsive and pulseless, in PEA
arrest. CPR was initiated, he recieved 2 mg of epinephrine, 1mg
of atropine, 1 of bicarb, and then a bicarb drip was started. He
was coded for 7 minutes. He was intubated and placed on dopamine
and levophed drips and transferred to the CCU. Vitals post
arrest on transfer were HR 84, BP 109/70, O2 Sat 97% TV 500,
PEEP 5, RR 14, and Fi02 100%.
.
His lactate was elevated to 8.5 prior to the code, so the ED
ordered a head CT which was negative, and a CT torso to look for
possible infection. He was started on vanc/levo/cefepime in the
ED.
.
In the ED labs showed an metabolic acidosis with an elevated
lactate. Labs were also notable for a HCT drop (35->31), a
supratherapeutic INR (7.4) and end organ ischemia with elevated
transaminases and elevated creatinine.
.
On the floor he was intubated and sedated, on dopamine and
levophed drips. A triple lumen RIJ was placed at the bedside. He
was started on dobutamine in addition to dopa and levophed with
a goal of transitioning the dopa to dobutamine. At the time his
BP was 85/40, HR of 86, and being ventilated on AC 500/5/18/100%
FiO2. He was started on cooling protocol. After the procedure he
was being turned, became bradycardic to the 40's and pulses were
lost. Chest compressions were iniated, he was given epinephrine
and bicarb. He had blood in his endotracheal tube as well as his
OG tube. Pulses returned, and he was maintaining pressures in
the 120s. He became bradycardic a 2nd time and pulse was lost.
CPR was initiated and he was started on an epinephrine drip. His
pulse and pressure returned, and he was sent to the cath lab for
tandem heart placement.
.
Review of systems positive for CP, cough, increased lethargy and
decreased activity over the past few months, nausea and vomiting
in the ED.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2133-8-12**]
FINDINGS: Single frontal AP upright portable view of the chest
was obtained.  A single-lead left-sided AICD is seen, with leads
extending to the expected position of the right ventricle.
Cardiomegaly is again seen, unchanged.  Hilar prominence is
without significant interval change and may be due to enlarged
pulmonary arteries and/or pulmonary vascular engorgement.
Calcifications of the aortic knob are noted. There is mild
prominence at the AP window, unchanged since prior. No focal
consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is
seen.

IMPRESSION: No significant interval change. Stable cardiomegaly
and enlarged pulmonary arteries.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2133-8-12**]
FINDINGS: Single supine AP portable view of the chest was
obtained. There
has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, with tip
approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. Per the clinical team, no
NG tube has in place. The right costophrenic angle is excluded
from the image. There has been interval development of slight
hazy opacity over the right upper to mid lung, which may be
asymmetric edema, interval aspiration versus artifact due to
patient positioning. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2133-8-12**]
FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage or major vascular territory
infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration for patient's age.  No mass effect or shift of
normally midline structures are noted. There is mild
opacification of the left frontal sinus. The remainder of the
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. No
fractures are noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
.
CTA TORSO W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2133-8-12**]
FINDINGS:
CHEST: Large area of opacification involving the right upper
lobe,
predominantly posteriorly, is seen. Given short-term development
since chest radiograph performed on the same date at 11:48 a.m.
(2 hrs prior), findings are concerning for aspiration with
possible partial right upper lobe collapse(although no
significant shift of midline structure), superimposed infection
is not excluded. On coronal image 400B, image 33, narrowing of
right upper lobe bronchus extending to the area of consolidation
is seen, which could be due to mucus plugging. Plate-like areas
of opacification in the anterior right upper to middle lobe
(series 5, image 22), may represent atelectasis, although
infection is not excluded. Additional areas of nodular opacity
along the periphery of the right upper, middle, and lower lobes
are seen. Additionally, on series 5, image 19, a subtle 4-5 mm
ground-glass opacity is seen in the left upper lobe. While
findings may relate to infectious and/or aspiration, follow-up
to resolution is recommended to exclude underlying pulmomary
lesion. Atelectasis along the dependent portion of the right
greater than left lower lobes is also seen. Overall haziness of
the lung fields with areas of septal thickening bilaterally
suggest fluid overload. No pleural or pericardial effusion is
seen. Extensive coronary artery calcifications are seen. AICD
lead is seen extending into the right ventricle. There is
cardiomegaly. Evidence of right heart failure is seen with
reflux into the hepatic veins. The main pulmonary artery is
enlarged, measuring up to 3.8 cm in diameter. The right main
pulmonary artery is also enlarged, measuring 3.4 cm in diameter.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism is seen, although evaluation
of the subsegmental branches is slightly suboptimal due to
patient motion. No evidence of acute aortic dissection is seen.
There are aortic calcifications. A prominent right paratracheal
lymph node measures 1.2 cm in short axis (series 5, image 17).
No hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy is seen. The esophagus is
patulous, but thin-walled. Endotracheal tube is seen,
terminating just below the level of the clavicles. A left
subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial
junction.

ABDOMEN: Evaluation of the viscera is suboptimal due to arterial
phase of
post-contrast image acquisition. Periportal edema is seen. The
spleen,
pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. The
gallbladder is
relatively collapsed and full of stones. There is evidence of
gallbladder
wall edema. Mesenteric haziness is seen throughout, which may be
due to fluid overload. Nonspecific bilateral perinephric
stranding is seen. There is no hydronephrosis. There are severe
atherosclerotic changes of the aorta and its branches. The
origin of the celiac axis, SMA, and left renal artery are
patent. Severe atherosclerotic changes are seen along the
proximal SMA where there is mural thrombus causing significant
narrowing (series 5, image 64) of the SMA, flow/contrast is seen
distal to this. There are atherosclerotic changes along the
right renal artery, with suggestion of narrowing at the origin.
Atherosclerotic changes of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are also noted with the
origin not optimally assessed, but appearing patent.

PELVIS: The appendix is not identified in the right lower
quadrant, but there are no inflammatory changes in the right
lower quadrant to suggest acute appendicitis. Foley catheter is
within a partially collapsed bladder. Air is seen in the
nondependent portion of the bladder, likely due to
instrumentation. There are severe atherosclerotic changes of
bilateral iliac arteries with extensive mural thrombus,
particularly along the right common iliac artery with focal
areas of near complete occlusion along the distal right common
iliac artery, (series 5, image 91) and proximal right external
iliac artery (series 5, image 96), with reconstitution seen more
distally.  Very trace pelvic free fluid is seen. Mesenteric
haziness is also noted in the pelvis, which may relate to fluid
overload. There is no bowel obstruction. The prostate is mildly
prominent. The seminal vesicles are symmetric. Scattered colonic
diverticula are seen. There is apparent minimal thickening of
the ascending [**Female First Name (un) 499**], although this may relate to
underdistension.

OSEOUS STRUCTURES: No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation
is seen.
Punctate sclerotic focus in the right femoral head and in the
left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] may represent a bone island in the absence of
known malignancy.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large area of posterior right upper lobe opacification,
developed in the interval since chest radiograph 2 hours
previous, findings most likely due to aspiration/partial right
upper lobe collapse, particularly given short term development.
Superimposed infectious process is not excluded. Evidence of
narrowing of a right upper lobe bronchus, which could be due to
chronic inflammation or mucous plugging, other process not
excluded. Additional areas of nodular opacity bilaterally, as
above, infectious process not excluded.  Recommend follow-up to
resolution.
2. Evidence of fluid overload with diffuse pulmonary haziness,
septal
thickening, gallbladder wall edema, and mesenteric haziness.
Cardiomegaly with findings concerning for right heart failure.
3. Enlarged main and right pulmonary artery suggesting pulmonary
arterial
hypertension.
4. Severe atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, at the aorta
and its main branches, with focal areas of near complete
occlusion in the right common and right external iliac arteries
(with distal reconstitution) and with significant narrowing of
the proximal SMA. No evidence of acute aortic dissection.
5. Minimal apparent thickening of the ascending [**Last Name (LF) 499**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
relate to
underdistention.
.
TTE (Focused views) Done [**2133-8-13**]
Conclusions
The left ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = [**9-11**] %). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure
overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Biventricular dilatation and severe hypokinesis.
Mild mitral regurgitation. There is a wire/catheter passing
through the right atrium into the right ventricle.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-6-26**],
number and quality of images are much more limited on the
current study. The right ventricle is more dilated with evidence
of pressure-volume overload. Consequently, the left ventricle is
compressed and less dilated on the current study. Biventricular
function is probably worse. The previously mentioned strands on
the catheter are not visible on the current study.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2133-8-13**]

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right IJ
line appears to have been advanced. The tip of the line now
projects over the basal parts of the right atrium, the line
should be pulled back by approximately 6 to 7 cm. The other
monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The
pre-existing parenchymal opacities in the right lung are
unchanged. The retrocardiac opacities have markedly increased,
so that the major parts of the retrocardiac lung areas are now
atelectatic. The overall size of the cardiac silhouette is
unchanged.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2133-8-14**]

CHEST FLUORO [**2133-8-17**]
Single fluoroscopic view was taken.  Swan-Ganz catheter tip is
in the distal right pulmonary artery or most likely in the
interlobar artery and should be withdrawn for standard position.


CARDIAC CATH [**2133-8-17**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Successful removal of [**Month/Day/Year **]/membrance
oxugenator support cannula.

EKG [**2133-8-18**]
Sinus tachycardia and frequent atrial ectopy. Left atrial
abnormality. Low limb lead voltage. Left ventricular
hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-8-15**] the
atrial rate has increased. Ventricular pacing is no longer
recorded.

LIVER/GB US [**2133-8-18**]
IMPRESSIONS: 1. Engorged hepatic veins at confluence with IVC,
consistent with CHF. No ascites. 2. Uncomplicated cholelithiasis
redemonstrated. 3. Normal son[**Name (NI) 493**] exam of liver, with no
focal liver lesion seen.

CT-HEAD W/O CONRAST [**2133-8-18**]
IMPRESSION: No new hemorrhage, edema, infarction, or masses. New
onset
sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening.

LEFT GROIN US [**2133-8-18**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of left groin pseudoaneurysm, hematoma,
or AV
fistula.

AP CXR [**2133-8-19**]
Comparison is made with prior study performed the day earlier.
ET tube tip is in standard position, 5.1 cm above the carina.
Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the right main pulmonary artery. NG
tube tip is in the stomach. Left transvenous pacemaker lead
terminates in the standard position in the right ventricle.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. The pulmonary arteries are
significantly dilated consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
This is unchanged from prior studies. Diffuse lung opacities are
unchanged from the day before but increased from [**8-16**],
worrisome for aspiration given the clinical concern. The
component of pulmonary edema has improved. There are no large
pleural effusions. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has
minimally improved consistent with improved atelectasis.

R UE US [**2133-8-23**]
No evidence of DVT.

AP CXR IJ [**2133-8-23**]
Single chest radiograph is compared to multiple prior
examinations. Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. Right IJ
catheter terminates at the superior vena cava. Left subclavian
pacer AICD terminates in the right ventricle.  Cardiomegaly,
moderate congestive failure, left pleural effusion, left lower
lobe consolidation persists. No pneumothorax identified.

AP CXR PICC [**2133-8-25**]
1. Right-sided PICC at the low SVC. 2. Moderate pulmonary edema,
slightly improved when compared to prior exam. 3. Worsening
retrocardiac opacity likely representing atelectasis.

AP CXR [**2133-8-30**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing
parenchymal opacities have decreased in extent and severity.
However, they are still clearly visible in both the left and the
right lung. Unchanged is the borderline size of the cardiac
silhouette as well as the increased diameter of the hilar
vascular structures. No evidence of larger pleural effusions. No
evidence of pneumonia.

TTE [**2133-8-27**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=[**9-11**]
%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe LV systolic function, mildly improved
compared to prevous study. RV function mild depressed, markedly
improved. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

Compared to study performed on [**2133-8-13**], the RV is slightly
smaller and its function slightly better. The LV is similar.
Severe pulmonary hypertension and moderate TR have persisted.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 year old Male with PMH of HTN, DMII, HLD, non-ischemic CM EF
of 15%, a-fib, and PHTN that presented after 2 month chronic
decompensation and 2 days of [**3-7**] chest pain found to be
tachycardic s/p multiple PEA arrests with resuscitation.
.
# PEA Arrest, Cardiogenic Shock, Biventricular Heart Failure:
Dr. [**Name (NI) **] (pt's PCP) checked an EKG that showed a rate of 138, that
was interpreted as sinus tachycardia with no signs of ischemia.
He was given a nitroglycerin tab, which resolved his chest pain,
as well as a chewable aspirin. He was supposed to get 25mg of
lopressor in the office, but it was unclear if he got it prior
to transfer. Pt was transferred to ED, where there was concern
for STEMI with ST elevations in lead V4 on transport, however,
the initial EKG in the ED showed tachycardia with ST depressions
in V6. Initial vitals were HR 133, BP 101/71, RR 28, SaO2 100%
RA, T 96.5, HR 130s. He had persistent chest pain with nausea
and vomiting in the ED and there was a question of EKGs showeing
possible a-flutter. Pt recieved 1 tab of nitro and lopressor 5mg
IV x2; however, his SBP dropped to the 60's and he became
unresponsive and pulseless, in PEA arrest. CPR was initiated, he
recieved 2 mg of epinephrine, 1mg of atropine, 1 of bicarb, and
then a bicarb drip was started. He was coded for 7 minutes. He
was intubated and placed on dopamine and levophed drips and
transferred to the CCU. Vitals post arrest on transfer were HR
84, BP 109/70, O2 Sat 97% TV 500, PEEP 5, RR 14, and Fi02 100%.
.
Pt was found to be in cardiogenic shock. Likely etiology was
decompensated heart failure with poor forward flow and resultant
end organ ischemia vs. myocardial infarction.  He had documented
stenosis of 80% in the RCA, and a last documented EF of 15%.  On
admission his lactate was 8.5 with a creatinine of 1.7 and
transaminitis. His white count was normal on admission but then
began to rise. However, given aspiration and findings on CT of
apical right sided consolidation that was likely aspiration
related, PNA could not be ruled out.  He was given broad
spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential sepsis which
consisted of vanc/levo/cefepime in the ED and then was changed
to vanc/zosyn/cefepime on the floor.
.
On the floor he was intubated, sedated, and on dopamine and
levophed drips. A triple lumen RIJ was placed at the bedside.
Dobutamine was added with a goal of transitioning the dopamine
to dobutamine and was started on cooling protocol; however, the
patient became bradycardic to the 40's and pulses were lost.
Chest compressions were iniated, he was given epinephrine and
bicarb.  Pulses returned, and he was maintaining pressures in
the 120s. He had blood in his endotracheal tube as well as his
OG tube. He became bradycardic a 2nd time, pulses were lost and
CPR was initiated again and pt was started on an epinephrine
drip with return of pulse and pressure. At this point, pt was
sent to the cath lab for tandem heart placement.
.
After placement of [**Name (NI) 61403**], pt was transeferred back to the
CCU.  On arrival he had 2.5LPM circulation off of pressors but
circulation began to slow below 2LPM and MAPs began to drop to
the 50s.  He again became pulseless and CPR was initiated.  He
was given multiple rounds of epinephrine, atropine, bicarb,
magnesium, and calcium and chest compressions. He was started
back on dopamine, epinephrine, and levophed. A bedside echo
showed compression of the LA and LV by a massively dilated RA
and RV from [**Name (NI) 61403**] circulation.  The cannula was withdrawn
from the LA and positioned in the RA and it was hooked up to
ECMO.  Pt marginally improved after readjustment of [**Name (NI) 61403**]
and initiation of ECMO.

Milrinone was started while on ECMO and he was requiring
0.5mcg/kg/min and at first did not tolerate turning down the
flow of the tandem heart, but over the course of a few days, the
[**Name (NI) 61403**] and ECMO were able to be removed while maintaining
the dose of milrinone. He was continuing to require milrinone
for ionotropic support of his poor EF.  Prior to extubation he
was started on nitrous oxide in order to try and decrease his PA
pressures.  He showed some improvement, but not did not get his
Wood's units for PVR less than 5.  He was placed on sildenafil,
and tolerated the medication well. After extubation, his mental
status steadily improved, and his pressures improved as well.
He was diuresesd with a lasix drip because he appeared fluid
overloaded with pulmonary edema and a 10kg increase from his
admission weight. On [**8-22**], he was extubated and
mentally at baseline.

In the interval between extubation and discharge, clinical
management was directed at optimizing volume status and
preparing the patient for discharge on a medication regimen
amenable to his tenuous social situation in the absence of
insurance. For social reasons, milrinone was titrated down; the
patient tolerated this well. Sildenafil was continued and the
patient was discharged on a dose of Sildenafil 40mg TID. IV
Lasix was transitioned to Torsemide, which was titrated to 10 mg
PO daily prior to discharge. The patient was also discharged on
Lisinopril 5 mg, as well as Warfarin 2 mg PO daily and Aspirin
81 mg daily. His home dose of Digoxin 0.125mg daily was
restarted the day of discharge.
.
# Coagulopathy: Pt had a supratherapeutic INR on coumadin at 7.4
on admission.  He was ordered for FFP to correct his
coagulopathy.  He had blood in his OG and ET tubes, with a HCT
drop.  There was concern for alveolar hemmorrhage based on CT
findings but pt had also aspirated. Over the course of his the
first 24hrs he was given 2 units FFP and 2 units PRBC. HCT
improved but did not bump appropriately. Given extracorporal
blood volume in [**Month (only) 61403**] ECMO, possible continued bleeding
due to high INR and pt's critical status, an additional 3 units
of PRBCs were given over the next 24hrs. HCT improved to >30. Pt
was switched to heparin gtt for continued anticoagulation needs
given [**Month (only) 61403**] ECMO and immobility. Heparin was discontinued
once his INR was therapeutic.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Patient status post ventricular
fibrillation arrest in the setting of end stage renal
disease/hyperkalemia

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
male with a history of end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis, status post inferior non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction in [**2170-11-18**] with subsequent
pre-discharge ETT/MIBI notable for decreased blood pressure
response and fixed inferior and apical defects.  TTE notable
for 3+ AI, 3+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation, with inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis.  The
patient deferred evaluation for valvular surgery at that
time.  Prior to discharge, ultrasound of his left upper
extremity arteriovenous fistula suggested organizing
thrombus.  The patient was able to continue hemodialysis on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday leading up to [**2171-3-4**],
when hemodialysis was reportedly impaired.  Thus the patient
was to present today for arteriovenous fistula revision.  The
patient became suddenly unresponsive in the parking lot, was
shocked on arrival to the Emergency Department, and was found
to be in ventricular fibrillation.  The patient was intubated
and shocked to atrial fibrillation, then converted to sinus
rhythm and given amiodarone 150 mg x 1, after which the
patient had sinus bradycardia at 40 beats per minute with
blood pressure 70/30.  The patient was given 1 mg of atropine
and dopamine with subsequent stabilization.  Stat
laboratories disclosed a potassium of 5.2, and a BUN and
creatinine of 76 and 13.3.  Head CT did not disclose evidence
of an acute process, and chest x-ray was clear.  Trauma line
was inserted into the right groin, and arterial line was
placed in the left groin.  The patient received bicarbonate
and calcium gluconate.  Stat echocardiogram showed no new
wall motion abnormalities.  The patient was transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit for further management.

ALLERGIES:  Levaquin gives the patient a rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] quit
smoking 30 years ago.  He had smoked for 60 pack years.  He
denies use of alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.2, heart rate 70,
normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 140/50, respiratory rate
14, oxygen saturation 99%.  Ventilator setting:  IMV 50%,
700, tidal volume 700, respiratory rate 14.  Arterial blood

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 15.3, hematocrit 37.4, platelet
count 224.  Chemistries:  Sodium 141, potassium 5.9, chloride
100, bicarbonate 23, BUN 75, creatinine 11.8, glucose 186.
INR was 1.2, PT 13.7, PTT 38.9.  Magnesium 2.2, free calcium
1.25, fibrinogen 347.  CK initially was 110, amylase 74,
CK/MB 7, lactate 12.5 at 11:15 A.M. 4 at 12:13 A.M.

RADIOLOGY:  Head CT showed an old lacunar infarct, mild
atrophy, no acute process.  Chest x-ray:  EPT well
positioned, no acute process.  Electrocardiogram:  Normal
sinus rhythm at 74 beats per minute, normal axis and
intervals, Q waves in III and AVF, very mild peaked
precordial T waves, no acute ischemic ST changes.

IMPRESSION:  78-year-old male status post ventricular
fibrillation arrest in the setting of relatively mild
hyperkalemia, all following possible suboptimal dialysis two
days ago.  Significance of underlying coronary artery disease
as inciting factor is unclear.  The patient has no history of
cardiac catheterization pre or post non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction in [**2170-11-18**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for further management.  The patient underwent stat
dialysis to reverse his hyperkalemia.  Further amiodarone was
held.  As noted above, the patient was intubated and was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

1.  Cardiovascular:
A.  Coronary artery disease:  Following the patient's
dialysis, he went for cardiac catheterization.  Coronary
angiography revealed severe two vessel coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA had no significant stenosis.  The left
anterior descending had a focal 80% stenosis in the proximal
vessel and luminal irregularities throughout the remainder of
the vessel.  The left anterior descending supplied a
moderate-sized bifurcating D1 that had an 80% stenosis in the
lower pole.  The left circumflex had diffuse luminal
irregularities and supplied a large trifurcating obtuse
marginal I and a small obtuse marginal II before terminating
in the AV groove.  The obtuse marginal branches were free of
significant disease.  The right coronary artery had serial
99% lesions in the proximal and mid-vessel, with evidence of
low flow in the distal vessel.  The posterior descending
artery and PLV were small and filled faintly.

Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal left ventricular
filling pressures with an left ventricular end diastolic
pressure of 15 mm Hg in the setting of normal systemic
arterial blood pressure, no gradient across the aortic valve
was seen.

Left ventriculography demonstrated inferior and posterobasal
hypokinesis with a calculated left ventricular ejection
fraction of 45%, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation was seen.

Rotational atherectomy/PTCA/stenting of the right coronary
artery was performed using three stents.  There was 10%
residual stenosis, normal flow, and no apparent dissection.

Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty/stenting of the proximal left anterior descending
was performed as well.  There was no residual stenosis,
normal flow, and no apparent dissection.

The patient was maintained on aspirin and statin, and was
started on Plavix, which he will require for 12 months.  As
the patient's blood pressure tolerated, he was started on a
beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.

B.  Rhythm:  As noted above, the patient was found to be in
ventricular fibrillation in the Emergency Department.
Etiology of rhythm may be due to scar from prior myocardial
infarction, but cannot exclude hyperkalemia or ischemia.
While the patient was in the Coronary Care Unit, he was
monitored closely on telemetry and was noted to have episodes
of atrial fibrillation/flutter.  The patient converted back
to normal sinus rhythm on his own.

An EP consult was obtained for further evaluation and
possible implantation of AICD.  The EP service thought that
the patient's arrhythmia was likely due to ischemia based on
his cardiac anatomy.  The patient was to go for EP study on
[**3-20**], however, once on the table, he refused the study.
The patient's family wishes for patient to undergo study.
The patient was not willing to undergo the study today.
Risks and benefits of AICD placement have been explained to
the family by the EP service.  Should the family decide that
the patient will undergo the EP study in the future, the
family should contact Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] at [**Hospital1 346**].

C.  Pump:  The patient's beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were
titrated up as tolerated during his hospital stay.
Echocardiogram on [**2171-3-6**], disclosed mild dilatation
of the left atrium.  There was mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy.  There was mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of
the inferior wall and inferior septum.  Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  There was at
least moderate 2+ aortic regurgitation.  The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened, moderate to severe 3+ mitral
regurgitation is seen.  There is no pericardial effusion.

D.  Anticoagulation:  The patient was not anticoagulated
during this admission due to bleeding complications as will
be discussed below.  While at rehabilitation, the patient's
hematocrit should be checked in five days.  If hematocrit
remains stable, that is, greater than 33, he should be
started on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

2.  Renal:  As noted above, the patient underwent stat
dialysis on the day of his presentation to reverse
hyperkalemia.  He undergoes hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday
and Friday.  A temporary Quinton catheter was placed in the
patient's right internal jugular vein since his left
arteriovenous fistula was not working properly and needed to
undergo embolectomy.

On [**3-12**], it was noted that the patient's hematocrit had
decreased to 24.  The patient also complained of back pain.
CT scan of the chest disclosed a malpostioned right internal
jugular central venous catheter with the tip lying freely
within the soft tissues of the mediastinum.  Soft tissue
density was observed in the mediastinum, which was thought to
be a component of both fluid and hematoma.  Cardiothoracic
Surgery service was consulted, and it was believed that the
patient had sustained an injury to the superior vena cava.  A
chest tube was placed on the right for drainage of the
hemothorax.  Echocardiogram was done, and echocardiogram did
not disclose evidence of the catheter tip in the right atrium
or right ventricle.  The patient was administered a total of
seven units of packed red blood cells, three units of
platelets and DDAVP for management of the bleed.  The chest
tube was discontinued on [**3-18**].

A right femoral vein hemodialysis catheter was placed for
hemodialysis access.

The patient underwent thrombolysis of the left upper
extremity AV graft on [**3-15**].  The AV graft was used
successfully for dialysis on [**3-18**].

3.  Heme:  As noted above, the patient's hematocrit dropped
to 24 on [**3-12**].  The patient's CT scan disclosed evidence
of thoracic bleed.  The patient required seven units of
packed red blood cells to maintain his hematocrit greater
than 30.  The patient's last blood transfusion was [**2171-3-15**].

4.  Pulmonary:  As noted above, the patient was initially
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit intubated.  He was
successfully extubated on [**3-8**].  There were no further
pulmonary issues.

5.  Nutrition:  The patient was maintained on a cardiac,
heart-healthy, renal diet.  He was administered Nephrocaps
and calcium carbonate with his meals.

6.  Neurological:  As noted above, the patient had a head CT
on [**3-6**].  There was no intracranial hemorrhage.

The patient was noted to have waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status
during his admission, especially at night.  He occasionally
required Haldol for agitation.

The patient still appears to have impairment of attention
span and short-term memory.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Patient to be discharged to
rehabilitation facility.

History of Present Illness:
75 year old female with past medical history of CAD MIx4 s/p 3v
CABG [**2174**], who was living at [**Hospital3 2558**] after two staged
spinal surgery [**2192-11-12**] complicated by NSTEMI.
.
She had an stress dobutamine echo prior to the surgery for risk
stratification. Per report, it was normal with no clear evidence
of ischemia. She remained intubated after the second surgery out
of concern for aggressive IVF resuscitation, with peak lactate
of 3.5 intra-operatively. She experienced an NSTEMI on [**11-14**]
with TWI in lateral leads and Troponins up to 2.667. Echo at the
time showed EF 50-55%, with inferolateral wall akinesis, basal
to mid-inferior wall is akinetic. Mid anterolateral hypokinesis
and the discrete mid-laterall wall aneurysm noted on dobutamine
stress images from [**2192-11-7**] was not visualized. Cardiology
consult was obtained and it was decided to medically manage her
NSTEMI.
.
According to the report, she was found pulseless and
unresponsive [**2192-11-27**], code blue was called and patient received
6 cycyles of CPR, AED was applied and shock advised after which
SROC occurred. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
managment and had agonal breathing in the ED, she was intubated
and admitted to the MICU. She was found to have multiple
pulmonary emobli and a possible ileopsoas abscess. She was
treated with the post arrest cooling protocol. She was started
on heparin bridge to warfarin, and was briefly treated with
antibiotics for supposed ileopsoas abscess however suspicion for
abscess was low and abx were discontinued. She had ECHO [**11-14**]
which showed EF of 50-55%%. Head CT was negative. [**2192-12-3**] She
was extubated and transferred to the general medical floor.
.
Cardiac enzymes were trended which never increased.
.
Following transfer to the general medical floor at [**Hospital1 18**], the
working diagnosis was that arrest was precipitated by PE versus
cardiac arrhythmia. She was seen by electorphysiology who
requested transfer to Inpatient cardiology service for an EP
study and possible ICD palcement.
.
Per Ms [**Known lastname 91304**] son, she was independent prior to her surgery.
She had limited motion due to her back pain but heart has not
been a problem for her since the CABG operation. Her son recalls
use of NTG only twice over the last 10 years. She did not have
any orthopnea, PND or lower extremity edema prior to her
surgery.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Coronary Catheterization
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant sytem revealed
severe
native two vessel coronary artery diseae.  The LMCA had no
significant
stenosis.  The LAD had a 90% narrowing at its origin and diffuse
disease
distally up to 90% in narrowing after a high D1.  The LCx system
had no
significant flow limiting disease.  The RCA had a total
occlusion
proximally with filling through left to right collaterals,
mostly via
the LIMA.
2.  Selective graft angiography revealed two stump occluded
venous
grafts, one to the RCA and one likely to the D1  The LIMA to LAD
was
widely patent supplying the LAD and RCA through collaterals.
Based on
graft amd native anatomy and collateral distribution, the
moderate sized
d1 is comproomised without patent graft or collaterals.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe native 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Occluded SVG to RCA and diagonal (presumed target); Patent
LIMA to
LAD.
.
Lower Extremity venous US:
FINDINGS: There is normal flow, augmentation and compressibility
of the
common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein and popliteal
veins bilaterally. There is normal flow and compressibility of
the peroneal and posterior tibial veins bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either lower
extremity.
.
[**2192-12-8**]
CXR
IMPRESSION:
Status post median sternotomy for CABG with overall stable
cardiac and
mediastinal contours. Interval placement of a dual lead
pacemaker with its
leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium
and right
ventricle, respectively. There is persistent blunting of the
left
costophrenic sulcus which may represent pleural thickening
and/or a small
pleural effusion. Linear opacities at the left base may reflect
post-inflammatory scarring or subsegmental atelectasis; an early
pneumonia is less likely. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No
pneumothorax. Spinal
fixation hardware overlies the thoracic and upper lumbar spine.
.
[**2192-12-6**]
Cardiac MRI: final report pending, this is prelim report
Impression:
1.Severely increased left ventricular cavity size with thinned
and akinetic basal to mid inferior and inferolateral walls,
consistent with a previous infarct.  The LVEF was mildly
depressed at 45%.
2.The aforementioned akinetic segments were not visualized in
the LGE sequences due to technical issues.  No CMR evidence of
prior myocardial scarring/infarction in the other visualized
segments.
3.Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
The RVEF was normal at 56%.
4.Aortic regurgitation (not quantified). Mild pulmonic and
tricuspid regurgitation.
5.The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending thoracic
aorta were both severely increased. The main pulmonary artery
diameter index was mildly increased.
6.Mild [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old female with CAD (MI x 4, CABG) and
aortic stenosis who presents status post cardiac arrest. Patient
was resuscitated in the field and received one shock from AED
she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where she was treated with the post
arrest cooling protocol with full neurologic recovery. She was
found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli on CTA chest without
evidence of right heart strain. Coronary catheterization showed
non-intervenable coronary artery disease, with the ability to
induce polymorphic Ventricular tachycardia. ICD was placed and
discharged back to rehabilitation in stable condition.
.
#Cardiac Arrest:
In the MICU, patient was managed with continuation of intubation
during cooling protocol. Cardiac enzymes were followed which
never increased. Echo revealed an ejection fraction of 35%,
which may be consistent with her cooling. Because of uncertainty
over whether pulmonary emboli fully accounted for the arrest
cardiology was consulted for concern of an ischemic insult or
arrhythmia. EEG throughout cooling protocol demonstrated
findings consistent with sleeping and no evidence of seizure
activity or neurologic deficits. After cooling protocol, patient
was extubated successfully after one attempt. Patient's
neurologic status returned to baseline soon after extubation.
Antibiotics were stopped as final read on CT abdomen
demonstrated seroma. Of note, patient had QT prolongation on
EKG, and EP was consulted for evaluation as well as ICD
placement. Once she was awake, stable and sent to the floor, she
had a coronary catheterization which showed non-intervenable
coronary vessel disease (please see pertinent results section).
Electrophysiologic study revealed inducible non-sustained VT
only, both uniform and polymorphic.  It is believed that
ischemia may have contributed to her arrest. She had an ICD
placed based on EP findings. Pulmonary emboli may also have
contributed to her arrest. This is being treated with warfarin
anticoagulation.
.
#Pulmonary Embolism: She reported no shortness of breath or
chest pain during her inpatient stay. As work up for her arrest,
she had CT chest which revealed bilateral segmental and
subsegmental pulmonary emboli. She was initially placed on
heparin with bridging to warfarin. She was discharged on
warfarin of 3 mg daily with INR of 2.5 on the day of discharge.
Given recent surgery with immobilization, this is likely a
provoked pulmonary embolism. She will need to continue warfarin
to maintain INR [**3-8**] until [**2192-5-28**] (6 months of therapeutic
anticoagulation).
.
#CAD: Given her extensive cardiac history, patient was continued
on atorvastatin and aspirin throughout her inpatient stay. Her
ACEi, beta blocker and Imdur were restarted after she was stable
in the floor post ICU course.
.
#Constipation: She was constipation in the first few days of her
stay. Milk of mag and bisacodyl supp PRN were provided to help
her have good bowel movements.
.
#Back Pain: Her pain regimen at rehabilitation was continued
while in the hospital. In the last few days, oxycontin was
discontinued, but gabapentin and Tylenol were continued.
Percocet [**2-5**] tab every 4 hours was added to be used as needed.
.
.
.
Transitional issues:
1. please follow INR three times a week and adjust warfarin
accordingly She will need 6 months of anticoagulation for
pulmonary embolism, final day [**2192-5-28**].
2. please follow up cardiac MRI final report

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],
.
It was a great pleasure taking care of you as your doctor.
.
As you know you were hospitalized for a cardiac arrest that you
experienced while at your living facility. You were
resuscitated, intubated and stabilized, and placed on
anticoagulation in lieu of finding pulmonary embolisms on
imaging.
.
During your stay, you had heart vessel catheterization which
showed narrowness in some vessels that were not intervenable.
You were evaluated by heart electricity doctors
(electrophysiologist) and they found that your heart has the
potential to develop abnormal life-threatening rhythm.
Therefore, a shocking device is placed which will shock when
such rhythms are detected by the device.
.
On discharge, you were in stable condition, alert, and oriented.

.
We made the following changes in your medication list:
-please STOP atenolol
-please STOP oxycontin
-please START aspirin 81 mg daily
-please START metoprolol 25 mg twice daily
-please START coumadin 3 mg daily. This is a blood thinner for
the clots in your lungs. The coumadin level (INR) will be
checked three times a week and according to it the doses might
be adjusted.
-please CONTINUE percocet. It contains acetamenophen. Please
make sure if you take extra acetamenophen, the total per day
does not exceed 4 grams.
-please TAKE milk of magnesia for constipation AS NEEDED for
constipation.
.
Please continue the rest of your medications the way you were
taking them at home prior to admission.
.
Please follow your appointments as illustrated below.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 year-old male with history of diabetes,
hypertension, and end stage renal disease who was transfered
from an outside hospital after a PEA arrest.  For the past week,
he has been feeling unwell.  One week ago, he underwent
placement of a perotoneal dialysis catheter.  At that time, he
required hospital admission for 2 days due to hyperkalemia and
hyperglycemia.  He was not dialysed at that time.  He had
persistent nausea.  The day prior to admission, he was back to
his baseline health, which is severe fatigue with ambulation of
a few yards.  The morning of presentation, he began to feel
nauseated.  Per report, he fell from his chair and was
unresponsive.  He had some jerking movements of his arms that
were similar to his hypoglycemic episodes.  Shortly thereafter,
he was responsive but then became unresponsive again.  When EMS
arrived, he was found to be bradycardic in PEA arrest.  He
received epi and atropine.  He subsequently became hypotensive
to the 60s systolic and was asystolic.  He was transcutaneously
paced.  He was taken to an outside hospital where he continued
to be hypotensive.  He received 4 L of IV fluid resuscitation.
A temporary pacer was placed, and he was paced at 80 beats per
minute.  Without pacing, he had only rare junctional escape
beats.  His labs were notable for hyperkalemia to 6.2,
hyperglycemia to the 700s, and acidemia with a pH of 7.03.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and his BNP was elevated to [**2175**].
An echocardiogram revealed an EF of 15-20% with global
hypokinesis and decreased right ventricular function.  He was
transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  On transfer,
his vent settings were noted to be incorrect and he was found to
be hypoxic to the 50s on 2 separate gases about 1.5 hours apart.
 On arrival he was oxygenating well.  He was on 5 mcg of
levophed to maintain his blood pressure.  He was intially
unresponsive, with fixed dilated pupils, with an absent corneal
and gag reflex.  An initial potassium was 6.4.  He received
calcium, bicarb, insulin, and kayexelate.  He was admitted to
the CCU.

Past Medical History:
1. Insulin dependant diabetes diagnosed 20 years ago.
2. End stage renal disease for about 1.5 years with plans to
start perironeal dialysis next month.  A PD catheter was placed
last week.
3. Hypertension
4. Hyperlipidemia
5. History of lens removal in left eye.
6. History of TIA


Social History:
He is currently not working.  He is married and has 2 children.
He smokes 1 pack per day.  He doesn't drink alcohol.

Family History:
His mother has a triple bypass in her 60s.  She also has
diabetes and hypertension.

50-60.
.
TTE [**2182-5-21**]:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. LVEF 40% Distal
anterior, apical, and distal inferior hypokinesis is present.
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated.

.
Exercise stress test: [**2182-5-22**]
The baseline EKG showed prominant voltage, diffuse STT wave
abnormalities and LAE. No additional, significant ST segment
changes
over baseline were observed during the infusion or in recovery.
The
rhythm was sinus with no ectopy. Appropriate blood pressure
response to
the infusion; blunted heart rate response. The dipyridamole was
reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or significant EKG changes
over
baseline. Nuclear report sent separately.

PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2182-5-22**]
RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
3.1 mCi Tl-201 Thallous Chloride;
21.0 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi;
HISTORY: Diabetes, ESRD, and hypertension, status post
hyperkalemia-related cardiac arrest. CAD evaluation.
SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose
of 0.142
milligram/kilogram/min. Two minutes after the cessation of
infusion, Tc-99m
sestamibi was administered IV.
INTERPRETATION:
Image Protocol: Gated SPECT
Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting
images.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial
perfusion model.

The image quality is adequate.

Left ventricular cavity size is dilated, and more dilated at
stress than at
rest.

Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake
throughout the
myocardium.

Gated images reveal diffuse hypokinesis without focal wall
motion abnormalities.The calculated left ventricular ejection
fraction is 48%

IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Transient
dilitation of the left ventricle during dipyridamole (stress)
images compared to rest, with a
baseline dilated left ventricle.


Brief Hospital Course:
49 year-old male with diabetes, end-stage renal disease,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia admitted with cardiac arrest likely
secondary to hyperkalemia and acidemia.
.
1. Cardiac arrest: Patient had an asystolic arrest in the
setting of hyperkalemia to 6.4 and acidemia to 7.0.  On arrival,
he was 100% paced with an underlying rhythm of 50-60s junctional
escapes.  He was also hypotensive requiring Levophed.  He was
treated for hyperkalemia in the emergency department with
calcium gluconate, bicarb, insulin, and Kayexalate.  His mental
status improved with treatment of hyperkalemia.  His EKG with
back-up pacing at a rate of 40 showed heart block with
occasional conducted beats with AV delay.  There was also some
inappropriate pacing spikes.  The sensing was decreased with
good effect.  He subsequently converted to normal sinus rhythm
without AV delay as his potassium was corrected.  His blood
pressure also improved with treatment of his hyperkalemia.  He
is currently off of Levophed. Patient had a repeat TTE which
demonstrated an improvement in his EF to 40%. Temporary pacer
was discontinued on [**2182-5-20**]. Patient did not have further
evidence of arrythmia. He will have close follow-up locally and
he will have his PCP refer him to a local cardiologist.
.
2. Chronic renal failure: secondary to diabetes and
hypertension. At the OSH the patient had a catheter placed with
the goal of starting peritoneal dialysis in 1 month. However,
during that hospitalization, he then developed hyperkalemia and
subsequent PEA arrest, which required transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].He was
dialyzed on the night of admission and had two additional
sessions of hemodialysis while in-house. Tunneled dialysis line
placed [**5-22**] and out-pt hemodialysis was coordinated; he has
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] his nephrologist on [**2182-5-25**].
.
3. Diabetes: He was hyperglycemic to 700s initially without any
evidence of ketosis.  He received insulin and was started on an
insulin drip.  He was requiring 1 unit per hour.  On hospital
day 2, he was transitioned to NPH and the insulin drip was
weaned off. He was discharged on a regimen of glargine and
lispro.
.
3. Congestive Heart Failure: At the outside hospital, he had an
echocardiogram that showed diffused hypokinesis with an ejection
fraction of 15-20%.  It also showed decreased right ventricular
function.  According to his wife, he had a normal echocardiogram
on month prior.  Repeat ECHO at [**Hospital1 18**] showed at EF of 40%. His
EF may continue to improve following this event.  He should have
a repeat ECHO in the next several months.
.
4. Elevation in cardiac enzymes: On admit, he had a troponin
leak that was likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of
his arrest.  Also, noted to have elevated CK-MB. Enzymes trended
down during his admission. He did not have a cath while he was
here. He will discuss elective cardiac catheterization at
follow-up with his PCP and primary cardiologist.
.
6. Hypertension:  Was briefly on pressors, then as pressure came
up required Nitro for blood pressure control  (initially
avoiding nodal blocking agents). Additional agents were slowly

TITLE: Medical ICU Resident/MERIT Admission Note



Reason for transfer to the MICU:  post-arrest management



History of Present Illness and MICU Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 12303**] is a 19
year old male with a history of polysubstance abuse most
significant for intravenous heroin, who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED for post-cardiac arrest care in the setting of an apparent
heroin overdose. He was transferred from [**Hospital3 **].
Briefly, he was discharged from a rehab center in [**State 108**] one
day prior to admission.  Last night, at 3AM on [**2145-4-10**], his
mother found him down with needles around. She immediately
called 911 and initiated CPR. He was intubated in the field per
the [**Location (un) 5700**] service ambulance record and dopamine and levofed
were initiated;  his pupils were reportedly fixed and dilated at
that point. Patient cooling was also performed via ice packs. At
[**Hospital3 **],  advanced cardiopulmonary life support was
continued for over 40 minutes at which point the patient
regained a pulse. His labs at [**Hospital1 **] were notable for a WBC
14.2, Hct 45.2, Plt 210.  Sodium 145, k 6.5, cl 107, co2 14,
gluc 247, bun 19, cr 2.3, ca [**43**].  He was then transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED he was on three pressors (epinephrine,
levophed, and vasopressin).  His blood cases were checked twice
and showed 6.79/86/61 -->6.87/67/82.  He was transferred to the
MICU. In the MICU, he did not have a  femoral pulse. A cardiac
monitor was placed and he was noted to have pulseless electrical
activity. ACLS was initiated. He received sodium bicarbonate,
calcium chloride, d50, NS, and boluses of epinephrine. His
rhythm converted to ventricular fibrillation and he was shocked.
He then converted to PEA and regained a pulse after another
bolus of epinephrine. The family was present. The code lasted
just under ten minutes. After discussion with the family, the
decision was made not to escalate care (see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]??????s note).
He remained on three pressors with ventilatory support.  Within
one hour he became bradycardic and expired. See written death
note in the chart. The organ bank declined the case for
donation. The Medical examiner accepted the case. The family
declined discretionary autopsy. Death report and other necessary
documentation was filed.

Chief Complaint:
s/p Cardiac Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
ICD placement


History of Present Illness:
50F with hx of coronary vasospasm, HTN that presents from an OSH
after having suffered a cardiac arrest in the field, s/p CPR
with shock x1.

Of note the pt was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service at [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (3) 1517**] after a month of increasing chest discomfort
concerning for coronary ischemia. While hospitalized, she had
dynamic ST depressions in V3-V6 during anginal episodes and
elevated trop to 0.16. At that time workup included both cardiac
cath (X2) and CT of the coronary arteries. Cath suggested
isolated bilateral coronary ostial stenosis. CTA was without
evidence of atherosclerosis. At the time it was thought the pt
suffered from cardiac vasospasm and not CAD. The pt was placed
on diltiazem, Imdur, and amlodipine. The pt followed up in
cardiology clinic [**5-25**] and at the time was feeling with only 2
lesss severe episodes of retrosternal chest pressure, [**4-12**], that
occurred spontaneously without exertion, lasting 10 min with
complete resolution. The pt had been able to participate in
aerobic exercise, 45 minutes and endorsed 40lbs wt loss while on
Weight Watchers program. The pt was last seen by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**2150-6-8**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**], at which time she was feeling well. At the
time she reported LE edema since initiating amlodipine.

This morning the pt was bringing her children to school. Family
notes that patient has had increased chest discomfort this week
and using nitroglycerin at work. Her daughter notes chest pain
this morning which resolved prior to taking her daughter to
school. EMS reports that arrived on scene with bystander CPR in
progress (approx 7:45). Arrest was confirmed. The pt was shocked
once. CPR was continued and on second analysis, no shock was
advised. At that time the pt was noted to move, Amiodarone 150mg
was loaded and subsequently transferred to an OSH.

On arrival to the OSH, (hx obtained by [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital ED
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1518**] via phone), initial vitals 108/55 HR 147,
Wt 99.7kg. The pt was intubated (two attempts made). HR ranged
from 123 to 151, with SBPs 108/55 to 174/74. 140's to 150's.
Exam was notable for pt as unresponsive but was reaching for the
tube. She did not respond to commandy prior to being intubated
with Succinylcholine 150mg, Versed 4mg, Vecuronium 10mg and put
on a propofol gtt. No acute EKG changes. Wbc 20. ck/trop neg.
CXR/CT of chest shows large aspiration pneumonia CT Head/CT
C-spine unremarkable. The pt was given Ceftiaxone 1gm,
Clindamycin 600mg, Azithromycin 500mg. 18G. Small lac to back of
head- going to get some staples prior to transfer. Vitals prior
to transfer were HR 124 117/57.

In the CCU, the patient is intubated. When propofol is weaned
patient moves all extremities however does not respond to
commands or follow directions.

On review of systems, unable to be obtained from patient. Family
reports that she was in her usual state of health and went to
the beach this past weekend. Besides chest pain episodes noted
above no other symptoms were reported by the patient. Family
notes patient to be a non reporter.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 year old female with history of coronary vasospasm presents
following a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.

# s/p Cardiac Arrest: Witnessed VF arrest in the field with
bystander CPR. EMS confirmed pulselessness and AED advised
shock. ECG here without concerning ECG changes for ischemia.
Given history of vasospasm may be secondary to vasospasm leading
to ischemia and subsequent VT/VF arrest. She was placed on
arctic cooling to protect cerebral function s/p cardiac arrest.
[**Month/Year (2) **] showed normal structure and function.  EEG showed abnormal
temporal lobe epileptiform but otherwise normal.  She was
started on aspirin, amlodipine, isosorbide mononitrate, and
simvastatin. She was noted to have ST elevation in V2-V4 on
[**2150-6-20**] during rewarming phase with subsequent VF arrest s/p 1
round of CPR and shock with ROSC - K returned at 2.7.  She was
following commands and thus decision was made not to reinitiate
cooling protocol.  She was started on IV nitro and diltiazem
drip which resolved the ST elevation in anteroseptal leads.
After extubation and improvement in her mental status, her
regimen was transitioned to nifedipine 60 mg po qdaily, imdur 60
mg po qdaily, verapamil ER 360 mg [**Hospital1 **]. EP was consulted and felt
the presentation could be due to long QT syndrome. She underwent
ICD placement on [**6-24**] - infectious prophylaxis was with
Vancomycin. CXR showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
.
# Neuroprotection s/p arrest: Interval between arrest and
initiation of cooling was 5 hours. On presentation with propofol
wean patient without purposeful movement. CT head negative from
OSH. Artic Sun therapeutic cooling protocol with goal core body
temperature 33 degrees x 18 hours. Patient sedated with fentanyl
and midazolam and eventually need paralysis with cisatracurium.
She was warmed per protocol and was oriented and following
commands appropriately within 48 hours.
.
# CORONARIES: Prior cardiac caths in [**Month (only) **] x2 both suggestive of
coronary vasospasm without flow limiting lesions. Has been on
amlodipine 10mg, dilt 240mg, and imdur 30mg as outpatient. ECG
at OSH unchanged from baseline. Regimen was changed to above
(see #1).

# PUMP: No prior [**Month (only) **] or LV gram in [**Hospital1 18**] system. Pt with hx of
HTN that was potentially thought to be white coat but unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] showed normal function.

# RHYTHM: No prior hx of arrhythmias however likely VF/VT arrest
on presentation and subsequent episode of VF in ICU. Thought to
be [**2-4**] coronary vasospasm. Long QT syndrome was also considered
and genetic testing will be pursued by EP and discussed and
followed up.

# Pulmonary Infiltrates: Pt with evidence of diffuse infiltrates
on OSH CXR and CT. Right upper load with air bronchograms
concerning for pneumonia, however bilateral pathcy infiltrates
concerning for early ARDS. Was placed on
CTX/Clindamycin/Azithromycin at OSH for suspected
CAP/Aspiration. Transitioned to IV unasyn and then IV nafcillin.
Nafcillin was changed to Augmentin on [**6-24**] and again to Bactrim
on [**6-25**]. Patient discharged wtih 7 day course of Bactrim [**Hospital1 **].

# Cloudy Urine: Urine appears ""dirty"" when foley catheter
placed. Continued on IV unasyn. Urine cultures were negative. No
further antibiotic coverage needed and patient remained
asymptomatic.

#dizziness: Pt complained of dizziness consistent with vertigo.
Pt received meclizine with improvement in her symptoms. No
evidence of orthostasis. Pt was ambulating without difficulty
prior to discharge. Pt will follow up with PCP regarding these
symptoms.

#hypokalemia: Mild evidence of hypokalemia requiring po
potassium supplementation. Pt was discharged with oral potassium
supplementation and spironolactone were started to help maintain
a normal postassium level. Pt planned follow potassium level 2
days after discharge.

#lower extremity edema: [**Location (un) **] likely secondary to calcium channel
blocker use stable from admission.

She was kept on subQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis. She remained
full code. Communication was with her husband.

from the episode. There may be some correlation with a prolonged
QT and hypokalemia as well. Your telemetry shows only short runs
of VT (3-4 beats) that are rare. You had an ICD placed that will
shock you out of any prolonged runs of VT. Please call the EP
fellow on call if this happens. You had a staph pneumonia that
is being treated with antibiotics.
.
We made the following changes in your medicines:
1. STOP taking aspirin, norvasc, diltiazem and zocor.
2. START taking Verapamil to prevent coronary vasospasm
3. START taking Nifedipine to prevent coronary vasospasm, please
take this at night
4. Increase the Imdur to 60 mg daily
5. Start taking spironolactone to increase your potassium
6. STart taking potassium supplements to keep your potassium up
7. Take meclizine as needed to prevent dizziness.
8. Take Bactrim twice daily for one week to treat the pneumonia
9. Take acetaminophen as needed for ICD pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 67870**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2121-11-28**] for
management after her cardiac arrest. The patient underwent
arctic cooling protocol. During her hypothermia therapy, she
required pressor support (dopamine and levophed). She was
started on atorvastatin therapy for presumed coronary artery
disease and a heparin drip. Per protocol, EEG was initiated with
montioring by Neurology department. The patient was also
enrolled in a study in which she either received placebo or
stress-dose steroids. She was then rewarmed. Amiodarone was
started for atrial fibrillation which converted her to a normal
sinus rhythm. By [**2121-12-1**], the patient was extubated and
conscious. Echocardiogram showed mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the septum
and anterior walls and apex, LVEF 35-40%. Cardiac
catheterization on [**12-3**] showed a patent left circumflex,
subtotally occluded LAD in the proximal region with two sizable
diagonal branches coming off this lesion. There was some mid LAD
disease as well. The RCA was chronically occluded with evidence
of left to right collaterals as well. Decision was made to
proceed to CABG after cardiac surgery was consulted. Mrs.
[**Known lastname 67870**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. On
[**2121-12-9**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 67870**] was taken to the operating room where
she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels.
Please see operative note for details. In summary she had: 1.
Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending coronary; reverse saphenous
vein single graft from aorta to the     second diagonal coronary
artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to the
posterior descending coronary artery.
2. Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting.
3. Reconstruction of the pericardium with Core Matrix.
Her BYPASS TIME was 64 minutes, with a CROSSCLAMP TIME of 52
minutes.
She tolerated the operation well and post operatively was
transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition. She
woke, neurologically intact and was extubated on the day of
surgery. All tubes lines and drains were removed per cardiac
surgery protocol. On POD2 she was transferred to the stepdown
floor for further post-operative care and recovery.
The remainder of her hospital course was uneventful. She
progressed well with her activity and was discharged home on POD
6.
she is to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks.

 Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Cardiac arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57 year old
male with a known history of coronary artery disease status
post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
approximately a year and a half prior to admission with stent
placement to the left ramus, who presented as a transfer from
an outside hospital after a witnessed cardiac arrest at the
beach.  Of note, the patient has a history of hitting his
head on a seawall prior to the event where he collapsed.  The
patient collapsed and went into ventricular fibrillation
arrest on the beach, and was subsequently shocked six times
and received 30 minutes of CPR resuscitation by a bystander.
The patient was sent to [**Hospital3 3583**] where he was in
electrical mechanical dissociation at 20 beats per minute,
given epinephrine, Atropine and Lidocaine 100 mg intravenous
bolus and 2 mg intravenous drip, where his heart rate then
returned to 100 to 110, and the patient became hypertensive.

At this point, the patient was intubated.  EKG showed a right
bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, deep
ST segment depressions in V2 through V4 suggestive of an
anterior septal myocardial infarction.  There is no
comparison EKG available.  The patient was given a heparin
intravenous bolus and no 2B 3A inhibitor secondary to the
history of head trauma.  The patient was sent to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for urgent catheterization.

Initial arterial blood gas upon arrival at the [**Hospital1 346**] was 7.16, 48, 76, and the patient
had a lactate of 4.5.  The patient had coffee ground on NG
lavage which was guaiac negative.

Upon catheterization, it was found that the patient had a
large patent foramen ovale with no left to right shunting.
He received three ampules of bicarbonate for worsening
acidosis.  His anatomy showed aneurysmal left main and left
anterior descending.  His wedge pressure was elevated at 24.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, which was
complicated by a left groin bleed.  The left anterior
descending artery was stented.

During the procedure, the patient received Lasix, three
ampules of bicarbonate and was on a Nitroglycerin drip.
Subsequent to stenting, the patient coded for electrical
mechanical dissociation and severely dropped his blood
pressure.  The patient's status was reversed with Atropine,
Dopamine, transdermal epinephrine and aggressive chest
compressions.  He was sent up to the Cardiac Care Unit on an
IABP and pressors.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post catheterization in
[**2170**] with stent to the left ramus.
2.  Ulcerative colitis, for which he sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 96511**].
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease times 15 years.
4.  Recent prostatitis for which he was on a course of
Ciprofloxacin.

MEDICATIONS UPON ADMISSION:
1.  Atenolol.
2.  Zestril 10.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg.
4.  Pentasa.
5.  Sublingual Nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  He lived in [**Location 745**].
He has four children and seven grandchildren.  He is a real
estate [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  He has a 20 pack year history of tobacco and
quit approximately 20 years ago.  The patient drinks a few
drinks per week of alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father died at age 66 of an
myocardial infarction.  The patient has two brothers with
heart problems.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission, vital signs with
temperature of 96.2 F.; heart rate of 150 to 160; blood
pressure of 80 to 100/50 to 60.  Intakes and outputs were
1500/300 in three hours.  Upon arrival to the Cardiac Care
Unit, his vent setting is controlled total volume of 800,
respiratory rate of 24, PEEP of 14, 100% FIO2, saturating at
99 to 100% on these setting.  Arterial blood gas 7.23, 49,
and 114.  Swan revealed right atrial pressures of 41, right
ventricle pressure of 40, PA pressure of 38/19; wedge
pressure of 24.  Cardiac index of 2.56 which decreased to
1.3.  Generally, the patient is an ill-appearing gentleman
who was paralyzed and sedated.  HEENT examination:  Pupils
were small and minimally responsive to light.  NG tube was in
place.  ET tube was in place.  Neck examination:  Unable to
assess secondary to his cervical collar.  Cardiovascular
examination:  Increased rate, normal sounding S1, S2.  No
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lung examination upon anterior and
lateral auscultation, there were coarse breath sounds
diffusely with no wheezing.  Abdominal examination,
protuberant abdomen, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  He had Doppler-able dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally with cold extremities.  No peripheral edema.
Groin clamp was in place over the left groin.  Positive 1 cm
hematoma.  Arterial venous sheath in place in the right groin
with bleeding surrounding it.  Neurologically, the patient
was paralyzed and sedated.

LABORATORY:  Upon admission to the [**Hospital1 190**] were white blood cell count of 9.9, hematocrit
of 50.5, platelets of 290.  Sodium 142, potassium 3.7,
chloride 106, bicarbonate 19, BUN 22, creatinine 1.1, glucose
of 210.  PT of 14, INR of 1.4, PTT of 36.1.

CK, initial set 129, second set 666, troponin initial set
less than 0.2, second set 38.0.

Chest x-ray revealed a questionable adult respiratory
distress syndrome versus congestive heart failure.  Head CT
scan was negative for an intracranial bleed.  Report from the
Cardiac catheterization revealed large PFO aneurysmal left
main, left anterior descending notable for a long 80% lesion,
with a focal 90% lesion at the distal portion of the mid -
left anterior descending.  The ramus with stent which was
occluded.  The left circumflex artery was clear.  The right
coronary artery was large with minor irregularities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Briefly, the patient is a 57 year old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease status
post stent placement in [**2170**], who presented following
ventricular fibrillation arrest and prolonged resuscitation
with EKG changes suggestive of an anterior septal myocardial
infarction in the setting of increased troponin.  The patient
is status post an urgent catheterization with stent to the
left anterior descending and transfer to the Cardiac Care
Unit in cardiogenic shock with intra-aortic balloon pump in
place.
1.  Cardiovascular:  A) Coronary artery disease:  The patient
has a history of coronary artery disease status post stent to
the left ramus in [**2170**], now with EKG and enzymes suggestive
of anterior septal myocardial infarction with stent placement
to the left anterior descending.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled
and initial CK was 129.  CPK reached a peak at midnight on
[**10-5**] at 4,087 and the MB peaked on [**10-4**] at 77.

The patient was treated with aspirin 325 mg, Plavix 75 mg;
Lipitor 10 mg.  During his hospital stay, Imdur was added on
[**10-9**].

B)  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by
cardiogenic shock requiring pressors in the Cardiac Care
Unit, which were ultimately weaned off within the first two
days of hospitalization and intra-aortic balloon pump was
also discontinued.

The patient had an echocardiogram on [**10-6**], which
revealed an ejection fraction of 20 to 30%.  His course was
complicated by episodes of hypertension particularly during
the time while we were attempting to extubate the patient.
Pressures increased up to 230/110 transiently, which were
reversed with Lopressor.  The patient was on a regimen of
high dose Lopressor and Captopril during his stay which was
switched to once a day dosing of Enalapril 40 and Atenolol
100 a few days prior to discharge.  The patient was also
started on 10 of Norvasc for good blood pressure control.

Upon discharge, the pressures were consistently stable in the
120s to 130.

C)  Rhythm:  The patient is status post ventricular
fibrillation arrest.  He was seen by Electrophysiology
attending who recommended defibrillator placement.  He had an
abnormal signal average ECG on [**10-12**], abnormal for long
filtered QRS.  An ICD was placed on [**10-17**], and the patient is
scheduled to follow-up with Electrophysiology Service, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], as an outpatient.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated from [**10-3**] until
[**2172-10-12**].  He was successfully extubated on [**10-12**], and for
the remainder of his hospital stay was saturating well from
93 to 98% on two liters of oxygen.  Chest x-ray on [**10-6**]
showed evidence of bilateral lower lobe aspiration pneumonia,
which appears to be improving on a subsequent chest x-ray on
[**10-12**].  The patient completed a 14 day course of triple
antibiotic therapy.  Please see Infectious Disease below for
specifics of the antibiotic regimen.

3.  Infectious Disease:  On hospital day number two, the
patient spiked a temperature to 102.5 F., and continued to
have persistent fevers for approximately five to seven days.
He was started on an empiric triple antibiotic regimen on
[**10-5**], of Vancomycin, Flagyl and Levaquin.  Etiology of his
fevers remained unclear.  Possible causes are aspiration
pneumonia as evidenced on chest x-ray.  A CT scan of the head
revealed some evidence of sinusitis.  CT scan of the abdomen
revealed no evidence of retroperitoneal abscesses or
hematoma.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent times
three, which all returned negative.  The patient's sputum
grew Gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  The patient
continued on a 14 day course of triple antibiotic therapy,
completing his course of Vancomycin, Cefepime and Flagyl on
[**10-17**].  The patient remained afebrile from [**10-11**] until
discharge.

Infectious Disease was consulted early in the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course for their recommendations upon appropriate
antibiotic coverage for nosocomial infection.

4.  Hematology:  The patient was admitted with a hematocrit
of 50 which subsequently dropped three days later to the low
30s.  It was unclear where the patient was bleeding.  Upon
admission, he had some coffee ground emesis that was guaiac
negative.  All his stools were guaiac negative as well.  A CT
scan of the abdomen revealed no evidence of retroperitoneal
hematoma.  It was thought that the decrease in his hematocrit
may have been secondary to initial concentration followed by
dilutional effect of large amounts of fluid early in his
hospital course.  The patient was transfused one unit of
blood during his hospital course and his hematocrit remained
stable in the low 30s for the remainder of his course.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of
ulcerative colitis followed by an outpatient
gastroenterologist, and was started on Pentasa 1 gram four
times a day upon admission.  A rectal tube was placed during
the time when the patient was intubated, and following
extubation, the patient had multiple episodes of soft brown
bowel movements which peaked in frequency on [**2172-10-14**].  The
patient's outpatient gastroenterologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 96511**], was
contact[**Name (NI) **] for recommendations upon further management.  The
patient was started on Imodium once a day and subsequently
had decreased frequency of stools.   Clostridium difficile
was sent on multiple occasions which were negative.  The
patient is to follow-up with his outpatient GI physician
following discharge.

6.  Endocrine:  The patient was admitted with elevated blood
sugars in the low 200s, started on a Regular insulin sliding
scale with fingerstick blood sugar monitoring four times a
day.  The patient last required insulin on [**10-12**], and sugars
were within normal limits for the remainder of the patient's
hospitalization.  The patient should be followed up as an
outpatient for further evaluation of diabetes mellitus as he
had no prior history prior to admission.

7.  Neurologic / Psychiatric:  During the period
peri-extubation, the patient was extremely agitated,
requiring Ativan and p.r.n. Haldol.  Following extubation,
the patient had persistent short term memory deficits,
however, his long-term memory appears to be intact.  He had
decreased lower extremity motor strength which has
progressively improved during the course of his hospital stay
prior to discharge.

Psychiatry was consulted during his stay for recommendations
regarding medical management of his agitation and evaluation
of questionable delirium.

8.  Renal:  The patient has no known history of renal
insufficiency and tolerated aggressive diuresis during his
hospital course without a bump in creatinine.

9.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:   Prior to and just
following extubation, the patient was aggressively diuresed
as it was thought he had extravascular fluid overload.
Electrolytes were repleted as necessary.  The patient
tolerated a cardiac prudent diet prior to discharge without
problems.

10. Prophylaxis:  The patient was placed on Pneumoboots
following the discontinuation of heparin and was up and out
of bed and ambulating during the week prior to discharge.
The patient was started on Protonix 40 mg twice a day.

The patient was discharged with the following discharge
diagnoses, medications and instructions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
male with history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure with
biventricular failure, ejection fraction of 20-30% on
hemodialysis for volume overload/end-stage renal disease, who
was found [**1-1**] in nursing home unresponsive, pulseless,
apneic.  CPR was initiated.  Airway was opened and revealed
copious emesis in the oropharynx which was suctioned,
respiratory rate 1-2, rhythm PEA at a rate of 25-50.  Pacing
was initiated at 70 beats per minute.  Patient was intubated
in the field.

In the Emergency Department, patient was still in
PEA/asystole, received neophedrine 2 mg, atropine 4 mg,
arterial blood gas, intubated revealed 7.24 pH, pCO2 47, pO2
77 on assist control rate 20, tidal volume 600, PEEP 5.0,
FIO2 100%.  The patient had SBP in the 60s.  Was started on
Dopamine.  SBP raised to 140, however, baseline was in the
80s.  Laboratories revealed a potassium of 6.9, he was given
insulin calcium.  Repeat potassium was 6.4.
Electrocardiogram revealed peaked T waves.  Dopamine was
stopped with SBP in the 120s, then propofol was initiated for
sedation, for ventilation, and the SBP went down to 70, and
dopamine was restarted.

The patient developed frequent [**Last Name (LF) 105738**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] dopamine was
discontinued, and NEO was started with resolution of ectopy.
The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

MICU course notable for patient vented, neophedrine
continued, hemodialysis was performed for hyperkalemia felt
most likely due to tissue necrosis from primary
cardiovascular event versus tachyarrhythmia from elevated K.
The patient was initially unresponsive with dilated fixed
eyes, but mental status cleared and patient was back to
baseline.  Vent was weaned, and the patient was extubated.
The patient was started on Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
Flagyl to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia and line
infection given elevated white blood cell count.  Abdomen was
distended and tense, but at baseline, so no studies were
pursued.

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 3704**] is a 51 y/o man with no known coronary disease
who is transfered to the CCU [**2133-10-9**] after being admitted to
[**Hospital3 3765**] on the evening of [**2133-10-8**] following a cardiac
arrest.

The history of present illness is obtained mostly through his
wife, as the patient has relative amnesia regarding the events.
He had been active that day, having walked twice for extended
distances ([**3-22**] miles), mowed the lawn, gone up and down stairs
doing laundry, and carrying bundles of wood for his living room
fire. He had felt well through all of this, without chest pain
or dyspnea. He ate dinner normally and was watching the news on
TV. His wife subsequently heard him gurgling and he was found
with agonal breaths and non-responsive. His wife is not sure how
long between when she last spoke with him and when she heard his
strange breathin, but thinks it was on the order of minutes. She
is a physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] began CPR immediatly. EMS arrived [**4-25**]
minutes thereafter. There are no strips available for review,
but a shock was delivered, restoring NSR and a blood pressure of
130/80.

He was intubated in the field post-recsussitation due to a poor
respiratory effort and he was transfered to the [**Hospital3 3765**]
ICU. He was extubated on the morning of [**10-9**]. Labs were largely
insignificant - he had a CPK 214, MB 5.5, Trop Ultra of 0.345.
No echo was performed @ [**Hospital3 3765**]. He was hemodynamically
stable, was started on an amiodarone drip, and transfer
arrangements were made for consideration of cardiac cath and
further work up.

On review of systems, he reports feeling presyncopal for msot of
his life when he woudl exercise soon after eating. Of note,
however, is that a week prior to this episode, he was having a
vigorous game of [**Doctor First Name 13792**]-[**Doctor Last Name 13793**] during which he needed to stop and
rest. He was feeling faint and pale. He didn't note any
palpiutations, chest pain, or diaphoresis at the time.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

HPI taken from admission note.

Cardiac Cath [**2133-10-9**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow limiting
epicardial
coronary artery disease. The LMCA, LAD, LCX had no disease.
Cannulation
of the RCA with a JR4 guide did result into selective engagement
of the
conus branch. Manipulation of an AL1 guide cannulated the RCA
and
revealed a non-dominant vessel without coronary artery disease.
2. Limted resting hemodynamics showed mildly elevated left
ventriuclar
filling pressures measured at 18 mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography revealed a preserved EF of 65% with
normal wall
motion. The patient did not tolerate positioning of the
reference device
so measurement of the stroke volume could not be performed.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal
2. Normal ventricular function.
.
ECHO [**2133-10-10**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function.

[**2133-10-13**] Cardiac MRI
Structure and Function

There was normal epicardial fat distribution. The myocardium
appeared to
have homogenous signal intensity without evidence of myocardial
fatty
infiltration.
The pericardial thickness was normal. There were no pericardial
or
pleural effusions. The origins of the left main and right
coronary arteries
were identified in their customary positions. The indexed
diameters of the
ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal. The main
pulmonary
artery diameter index was mildly increased. The left atrial AP
dimension was normal. The right and left atrial lengths in the
4-chamber view were normal.
The coronary sinus diameter was normal.
The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index was normal.
The end-
diastolic volume index was normal. The calculated left
ventricular ejection
fraction was normal at 58% with normal regional systolic
function. The
anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal. The
left
ventricular mass index was normal. The right ventricular
end-diastolic volume index was normal. The calculated right
ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 51%, with normal
free wall motion. There was no focal thinning or fatty
infiltration seen in the RV free wall. There were no aneurysms
seen in the RV free wall or right ventricular outflow tract.
The aortic valve was tri-leaflet with normal valve area.

Quantitative Flow

There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt. Aortic flow
demonstrated
no significant aortic regurgitation. There was no mitral
regurgitation. There was mild pulmonic valve regurgitation. The
right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated
no significant tricuspid regurgitation.

Myocardial Perfusion and Fibrosis

There were no areas of focal hyperenhancement, consistent with
the
absence of myocardial scarring/infarction.

Impression:

1. Normal left ventricular cavity size with normal regional left
ventricular systolic function. The LVEF was normal at 58%. No
CMR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
The RVEF was
normal at 51%. No CMR evidence of right ventricular fatty
infiltration/dysplasia.
3. Mild pulmonic regurgitation.
4. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was mildly increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 y/o man with no known history of any CAD and minimal CAD risk
factors who presented after sudden cardiac arrest after being
revived with CPR/AED en route to ED.

1) Sudden Cardiac Arrest:
Pt with excellent exercise tolerance at baseline and normal
stress echo 4 years prior.  Admission cardiac cath showed no CAD
and ECHO WNL with LVEF >55%.

On scene strips corroborated V-Fib with changeover to sinus
rhythm.  Baseline EKG with LVH and ST-T wave configuration
consistent with early repolarization pattern, otherwise benign.


Since admission, pt had been in NSR to sinus brady on telemetry
and assymptomatic.  On morning of [**10-12**], pt described mild chest
tightness, attributed to anxiety based on description of pain,
unchanged EKG and recent normal cath. Cardiac MRI was done and
was normal. An EP study done on [**10-13**] showed no evidence of
abnormal conduction or inducable arrythmias.  On [**10-14**] an ICD
was placed without any complications and pt was discharged to
home on Toprol XL 25mg daily. After discussion, aspirin was
determined unnecessary given known clean coronaries.

Pt scheduled to follow up with electrophysiology to discuss need
for formal EP study and ask about need for any further EKG
screening of family members

2) Cognitive Impairment:
Pt had short term memory deficits that have improved steadily
during course of admission, most likely secondary to hypoxia in
setting of recent arrest.  Evaluation by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] of
neurology revealed minor deficits of low concern and excellent
prognosis for full recovery.  There was no evidence of seizure
and no indication for a brain MRI.

Discharge Instructions:
Your heart stopped while you were home, an event called ""sudden
cardiac arrest"" that was due to an abnormal heart rhythm called
ventricular fibrillation. You have a normal EKG, heart function
and no evidence of scarring on your cardiac MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 68714**] a
defibrillator to treat the very rapid rhythm that you had
before. You will need to come back to the device clinic in 1
week to comfirm that the device is operating properly. You need
to take antibiotics for 3 days as a precaution against infection
at the incision site. Your left chest area will be sore but the
soreness should improve every day. You should not have any
swelling, increasing pain, discharge or bruising at the site.
Please call the device clinic if you notice any of these changes
or if the device shocks you. Please follow all the activity
restrictions noted on your ICD sheet.

2940,Survived,"Admission Date:  [**2141-12-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2141-12-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2068-3-17**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year old female
who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
CCU after a ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. According to
the patient's husband and outside hospital notes, the patient was
in her usual state of health until the day of admission.  At
baseline, the patient's husband states she can walk up several
flights of stairs with no complaints of dyspnea on exertion or
chest pain.  The patient felt well up until the date of admission
with no fever, chills, sweats, upper respiratory infection type
symptoms or abdominal pain.

On the day of admission, the patient and her husband drove by
their mailbox.  The husband was in midsentence asking the
patient's eyes were looking up/rolling back in her head, and
she was nonresponsive sitting in the car seat.  The husband
denies the patient having any abnormal motor movements, no
incontinence, no vomiting.  She did not move at all.  The
husband was near the [**Location (un) 1121**] [**Name (NI) 1281**] Hospital and within a
few minutes (the patient's husband states definitely less than
five minutes) he was able to bring her to the hospital.

On arrival, she was reported as being in ventricular
fibrillation.  She underwent CPR and was intubated on
settings of AC 650 by 10 and shocked a total of six times.
There were no tracing available in the chart.  The patient
was given Lopressor, intravenous Nitroglycerin, intravenous
fluids, Amiodarone and Digoxin, started on a Heparin bolus of
6500 and continued at 1400.  Amiodarone was started at an
unknown dose and was eventually thought to be overdosed and
was held.

On arrival to the Intensive Care Unit at the outside
hospital, the patient's blood pressure was 85/54.  She was
given normal saline bolus and intravenous Nitroglycerin was
discontinued.  In the Intensive Care Unit, it was said that
the patient vomited large amount of undigested food.  She was
given 2 mg of Ativan times three and Morphine Sulfate 2 mg
times one for sedation.

Her laboratories at the outside hospital showed troponin of
less than 0.1 with a CK of 56.  White blood cell count was
8.4, hematocrit 37.2, platelet count of 230,000.  Partial
thromboplastin time 24.0, INR 1.0.  Cholesterol 189.  Chem7
was sodium 141, potassium 3.6, chloride 106, bicarbonate 19,
blood urea nitrogen 24, creatinine 1.8, glucose 220, albumin
3.5, calcium 8.4, AST 217, ALT 264, alkaline phosphatase 55,
bilirubin 0.5.  Arterial blood gases pH 7.34, 24, 434, status
post intubation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypothyroidism.
3.  Colonoscopy which showed question of polyp. Per husband,
the patient had abdominal surgery to remove an unknown type
of lesion.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Atenolol 50 mg once daily.
2.  Triamterene/Hydrochlorothiazide 37.5/25 once daily.
3.  Synthroid 125 mcg once daily.
4.  Avapro 75 mg once daily.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient had a
temperature of 99.9, pulse 54 and in sinus, blood pressure
112/44 and oxygen saturation 100% on vent settings of AC
600/10, 50% FIO2, PEEP 5.  The patient was easily arousible
and was responding to commands even though she was intubated.
Her pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Her neck
was supple with no jugular venous distention and no
lymphadenopathy.  Heart examination was regular rate and
rhythm, distant heart sounds, S1 and S2, I/VI systolic
murmur.  On abdominal examination, positive bowel sounds,
nontender, nondistended, soft.  Lung examination was clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Extremities no edema, warm and toes
were downgoing.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a wide left bundle
branch block, left axis deviation, the patient's baseline
from [**2139**].  Electrocardiogram at outside hospital revealed
rate of 143, wide complex tachycardia, no evidence of AV
dissociation or concordance.  T wave inversions in leads V2
through V6 which were new.

Chest x-ray showed no evidence of congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiology - The ventricular fibrillation arrest was of
unclear etiology.  Differential diagnoses of causes of
ventricular fibrillation included cardiac ischemia, underlying
cardiomyopathy or primary electrical disorders.   For workup of
this, the patient went for a cardiac catheterization on
[**2141-12-8**].  The results were as follows:  Hemodynamics were
read as the patient having a pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 17, A wave of 20, V wave of 18.  Her RV systolic
pressure was 37, diastolic pressure 10, end pressure 17, left
ventricular end diastolic pressure 22.  The patient's
coronary angiography showed a right dominant system.  The
left main coronary artery had a 40% distal lesion, left
anterior descending 70% proximal lesion, left circumflex
luminal irregularities, right coronary artery diffuse mid
disease with maximal stenosis of 50%.  Pressure wire
interrogation of the left anterior descending and left main
showed a FFR of 0.94, bradycardia in the laboratory was
accompanied by a long QT interval.  The conclusion of the study
was that the patient did have moderate coronary artery disease
but not flow limiting disease that would likely result in the
ventricular fibrillation arrest.  Therefore, as there was no
clear reversible cause of the patient's arrenst it was felt
that the patient would benefit from the placement of an ICD.  On
[**2141-12-8**], the patient had an ICD implanted.  There were no
complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The
patient had no repeat episodes of ventricular fibrillation during
her hospital course.

Pump - The patient had an echocardiogram prior to ICD
placement on [**2141-12-8**].  This echocardiogram showed a normal
left ventricle with normal wall thickness and cavity size
with a moderately depressed ejection fraction.  Of note, the
patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3175**], in
[**Location (un) 1468**], [**State 350**] was called to learn more about the
patient's past cardiac history.  The patient's physician said
that the patient had suffered from hypertension for many
years which had been managed with Atenolol and that based on
his echocardiograms from [**2132**], and [**2133**], the patient had a
hypertensive cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30
to 35%.  She had also had prior history of supraventricular
tachycardia and the left bundle branch block had been present
for many years on her electrocardiogram.  However, he states
that the patient had no known coronary artery disease and it
was felt that her cardiomyopathy was solely from
hypertension.  The patient's physician was unsure as to whether
she had been tried on an ACE inhibitor at some point in the past
and could not clearly report why she had been placed on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]
instead of an ace inhibitor. Therefore, it was felt that since
the benefits outweighed the risks in this case, the patient was
started on Lisinopril 5 mg once daily.  She tolerated this
medication well for two days prior to discharge.

Coronary artery disease - Based on the patient's coronary
angiography, she did have moderate coronary artery disease.  She
was therefore started on Lipitor 10 mg once daily.  She was
continued on Aspirin once daily and she was started on
Lopressor 25 mg twice a day once her heart rate was no longer
bradycardic as it had been after being in the catheterization
laboratory.  She tolerated these medications during her
hospital course.  As far as CKs, the patient's peak CK was
736 with a troponin peak of 3.3.  She had no further
electrocardiographic changes suggestive of ischemia and the
CK leak was thought to be secondary to the shocks that she
received at the outside hospital.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient was successfully extubated on
[**2141-12-8**], after she had come back from her cardiac
catheterization.  There were no complications from extubation
and when extubated, the patient's mental status was noted to
be clear.  There had been concern that the patient may have
suffered anoxic brain injury after her ventricular
fibrillation arrest, however, she was only down for a short
period of time per report.  She was alert and oriented times
three.  Her neurologic examination was fully intact with no
focal findings.  The only deficits noted were problems with
short term memory and this continued throughout the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course.  It did improve each day, however.

3.  Gastrointestinal - On admission and at the outside
hospital, the patient was noted to have elevation of her
liver function tests.  This was felt to be consistent with
shocked liver from hypoperfusion during ventricular
fibrillation arrest.  The patient's liver function tests did
come back to normal and they were checked just prior to
starting the patient on Lipitor 10 mg once daily.  The
patient did have one episode of coffee ground emesis after
being on Heparin for 48 hours.  This cleared after 400 ccs of
normal saline with nasogastric lavage.  The patient's
hematocrit dropped from 30.0 to 27.0 with this small upper
gastrointestinal bleed and in combination with a small amount
of blood loss with the ICD placement.  Gastroenterology was
consulted and aware of the patient.  It was felt that no
intervention needed to be done at the time as the patient was
stable and only had one episode of a small amount of coffee
ground emesis and as this was all in the setting of Heparin
use.  The patient had no further episodes of gastrointestinal
bleeding.

4.  Hematology - For the patient's hematocrit drop to 27.0 in
a patient with known coronary artery disease, it was felt
that the patient would benefit from blood transfusion.  She
was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells with a nice
response.  Her blood count went from 27.0 to 29.4.

5.  Infectious disease - The patient was found to have a
urinary tract infection by urinalysis and culture.  She was
given a three day course of Levofloxacin 250 mg once daily.
The patient remained asymptomatic from this infection.

The patient was discharged on [**2141-12-10**], to home with services
of physical therapy.  She was to follow-up with her primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3175**], in [**Location (un) 1468**], [**State 350**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Levothyroxine 125 mcg once daily.

PEA arrest, pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiopulmonary resuscucitation x 45 minutes
Post-cardiac arrest cooling by the arctic sun protocol
Placement of right radial arterial line
Placement of left PICC line

History of Present Illness:
53F with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal
dementia who is chronically debilitated and dependent on a PEG
and tacheostomy who was found apneic and pulseless at her
nursing home. CPR was initiated, and she underwent 45 minutes of
chest compressions. At that point she was bolused with
epinepherine 1mg IV and responded to a pulse of 140 and a blood
pressure of 140/90. She was transfered emergently to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
for further evaluation. EMS reported copious secretions in her
trach tube during transfer including what appeared to be food or
pills with tube feeds.
.
In the ED, initial vs were T 96.8 P 77 BP 94/55 R 12 O2 sat 100%
on FIO2 100% and intubated. Initial ECG showed ST elevations in
II, III, V2-6. Cardiology was consulted and felt she was not a
candidate for PCI. She was given aspirin 325mg PO x 1 and
started on a heparin drip. CT heat and torso showed PNA and no
acute intracranial process. She was fluid resusitated with 4 L
NS IV, started on vancomycin [**Last Name (un) 80630**] levofloxacin for aspiration
PNA, and a femoral line was placed. She was initially on
norepinepherine without adequate MAPs, and then improved once
dopamine was added. She was admitted to the MICU for further
management.
.
Upon initial presentation to the floor, she was intubated and
sedated.

Brief Hospital Course:
53F with amyotrohic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal
dementia admitted after 45 minutes of CPR for a PEA arrest,
completed Artic Sun cooling protocol and also had aspiration
PNA, treated with antibiotics.
 .
# s/p PEA arrest: The presumed etiology is aspiration PNA, given
the copious secretions in her trach tube during transfer. She
completed Artic Sun protocol. Although her initial ECG showed
some ST elevation, this resolved with subsequent ECGs and her
cardiac enzymes, including troponin, never elevated. There was
concern for anoxic brain injury, given her prolonged CPR. She
underwent EEG monitoring, which showed no seizure activity by an
absence of cortical activity.
.
# Sinus tachycardia: During her hospitalization, the pt became
intermittently tachycardic. The differential diagnosis included
hypovolemia/bleed (but her Hct stable), PE (but neg CTA on
admission, on ppx), pain/anxiety (but on Fentanyl), seizure
activity, fever (as pt w. low-grade temps around 101), and
reflex tachycardia from discontinuation of sedatives/home beta
blockers. It improved with Tylenol and metoprolol.
.
# Aspiration PNA: The patient had infiltrates on CXR and frank
aspiration in endotracheal suction. Her sputum cultures grew
MRSA. Plan for a course of antibiotics with Vancomycin 1g IV BID
and Zosyn 4.5g IV Q8H for 7 days (from [**2151-11-24**] to [**2151-12-1**]) and
Azithro 250mg IV q24h for 5 day course ([**11-24**] to [**11-28**]).  On
[**11-29**] induced sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and patient was
started on a 14 day course of Cipro 400mg IV BID and Zosyn 4.5g
q8H for 14 day course.  Sensitivities were pending at the time
of discharge.

Chief Complaint:
Malaise, Nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2194-11-7**]
ICD Placement [**2194-11-12**]


History of Present Illness:
77 year old man with a history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DMII, PVD
who p/w > 24 hours of malaise. He developed Vfib arrest in the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED and achieved a ROSC. He is being admitted to the MICU
for shock.
Mr. [**Known lastname 13859**] felt unwell throughout [**2194-11-6**]. He developed rigors
while eating dinner last evening. The patient felt unwell in the
evening and spoke to his PCP's office who suggested he come to
the emergency room. He had Nausea with vomitting in the middle
of the night. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED waiting area, the patient
collapsed and was found to be in ventricular fibrillation. He
received 1 minute of CPR, was defibrillated once and then
received 1-3 minutes of CPR during which time he was given one
dose of epinephrine and one dose of atropine. He began making
purposeful movements at which time pulses were checked.
Spontaneous rhythm therefore had returned within 5 minutes and
the patient was intubated for airway protection. Per the
Cardiology consultation, the initial (5:06:08) ECG was atrial
flutter with 2:1 conduction. There were dramatic ST elevations
in V1-V2 as well as inferior ST depressions. A subsequent ECG
showed more subtle ST elevations in V1-V2, as well as ST
depressions in the inferior
and lateral precordial leads. Given the uncertainty a CODE STEMI

was called. The patient was given Aspirin 600mg PR, Plavix per
OGT and started on heparin. It is unclear whether he ever
received [**Name (NI) 13860**].
.
Simultaneously the patient was found to have A dense RLL
infiltrate on CXR, a rectal temp of 103.0 and became
progressively hypotensive on propofol. His sedative was switched
to Fent/Versed but hypotension persisted. He was started on
peripheral norepinephrine. Vancomycin and Zosyn were provided
and a Right IJ triple lumen was placed. A second CXR was taken
to confirm placement of the line.
.
ROS per Cardiology Consultation: The patient's wife denies that
he ever complained of chest pain. He has never had any chest
pain. She denied frank dyspnea and said he did have a cough.
They had seen the podiatrist a day earlier to evaluate a non
healing ulcer on the plantar surface of his right foot. The
patient reportedly had no diarrhea. A complete review of systems
could not be obtained because the patient was intubated and
sedated.

TTE [**2194-11-7**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV
systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 40%)
secondary to hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free
wall, and apex. Midseptal aneurysm/dyskinesis is present. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Due to the technically suboptimal nature of this study, an
intracardiac shunt cannot be excluded on the basis of this study
(consider transesophageal echocardiography).

Cardiac Catheterization [**2194-11-7**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease. The left main
coronary artery contains a 60% lesion in the distal portion of
the vessel. The left anterior descending contains severe disease
in the mid portion of the vessel with occlusion after the third
diagonal. The distal portion of the vessel is supplied by the
left internal mammary artery. The circumflex artery contains a
proximal 60% lesion. The first obtuse marginal is a large vessel
that is proximally occluded and supplied by a saphenous vein
graft. The right coronary artery contains serial lesions to 40%
in the midportion of the vessel. The distal RCA is occluded and
is supplied by a saphenous vein graft.
2. Selective conduit angiography demonstrates the LIMA,
saphenous vein graft to right posterior left ventricular and
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal to patent.
3. Hemodynamics demonstrate an elevated cardiac output with
low-normal systemic vascular and pulmonary vascular resistances.
There is mild elevation in left and right  ventricular filling
pressures.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent bypass grafts.
3. Hemodynamics consistent with resolving septic shock.

ECG [**2194-11-7**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave changes.
Cannot exclude myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is
suggested. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2194-11-7**] ST-T
wave changes are less pronounced.

Portable cxr [**2194-11-7**]:
IMPRESSION: ET tube at 4.6 cm above the carina. Severe right
lung aspiration, pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or contusion.
Normal heart size; no pleural effusion.

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis [**2194-11-9**]:
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are bilateral, low density,
pleural
effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
Effusions are small. Diffuse areas of ground-glass opacity,
right greater than left, are non-specific. No pneumothorax is
seen. A calcified granuloma is noted at the right base (2:45).
There are mitral annular, coronary artery and aortic
calcifications. A small hiatal hernia is present. The airways
are patent to the segmental level. No pathologically enlarged
lymph nodes are seen.  Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are
present.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS: No fluid collection or sign of
retroperitoneal hemorrhage is seen. No free air is identified.
The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys
appear grossly unremarkable. The pancreas is atrophic.  Loops of
small and large bowel are of normal size and caliber. No
pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen.

The bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter. The prostate
gland appears grossly normal with punctate calcification. There
is a focal aneurysmal dilation of the infrarenal aorta measuing
up to 3 cm (300b:37).

BONE WINDOWS: Several rib fracture including left anterior
fourth, and right fifth and sixth ribs are seen. The patient is
status post median sternotomy.  There are multilevel
degenerative changes, most significant at L2/L3. No concerning
osseous lesion is seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
2. Diffuse ground glass opacities in lungs are non-specific and
may represent infection, inflammation, toxic/metabolic cause, or
small contusions in the setting of chest compression.
3. Bilateral small, simple appearing pleural effusions and
bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
4. Bilateral rib fractures.
5. Focal aneurysmal dilation of infrarenal aorta up to 3 cm.

TTE [**2194-11-12**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid anterior
septal dyskinesis/aneurysm and severe apical anterior septal and
anterior hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with regional LV systolic
dysfunction consistent with CAD. No significant valvular
abnormality seen. Mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
77yo M w CAD s/p CABG, DMII, PVD presenting with RLL pneuonia
and sepsis complicated by VF arrest, now s/p placement of ICD
.
ACTIVE:
#. Sepsis/PNA: Pt a/w hypotension, fever, WCC 11.9 CXR w large
patchy R lung opacity.  He was treated w IV azithromycin,
vancomycin, and ceftriaxone with subsequent improvement.  BP
rose to systolic 150s-160s and he was started back on his home
antihypertensives.  Cultures remained negative.  He was
transitioned to po antibiotics (cefopodoxime and azithromycine)
for CAP.  He remained stable and at discharge WCC was 7.4.  He
was discharged with a planned course of 14d abx.
.
#. Vfib arrest s/p ICD placement: Pt had episode of Vfib arrest
in the ED, and was rescusitated by ACLS protocol and received
one shock.  TTE demonstrated EF 40% w anterior septal and free
wall apical hypokinesis.  Per EP, it was thought hypotension
exacerbated old ischemic area, causing abnormal electrical
physiology.  Once stable w respect to other issues, EP felt that
given the patient's native 3VD and likely unrevascularized
substrate, it was thought that he was at increased risk for
future episodes of VF and could benefit from placement of an
ICD. Patient underwent ICD placement without complication and
was discharged w planned follow-up in Device Clinic.
.
# CAD: Initial post-arrest EKG demonstrated dramatic ST
elevations in V1-V2 as well as inferior ST depressions.  Cardiac
enzymes peaked at CK 1127, MB 82, Trop T 6.21.  The patient was
given [**Month/Day/Year 13860**], Plavix per OGT, rectal aspirin, and started on
a heparin drip. Urgently cath revealed 3 vessel CAD but patent
bypass grafts. His EKG returned to baseline and Cr trended down.
 It was thought that demand ischemia was exacerbated in setting
of hypotension, tachycardia, ARF, and cardiac resuscitation.  He
was continued on medical management with aspirin, beta blocker,
statin, plavix, and acei.
.
#. DM type II: On insulin NPH/regular at home; per pt current
regimen was 12 units in the morning, 12 units in the afternoon,
and 10 units at night.  He was continued on home insulin and
HISS. At discharge blood glucose was 100s-200s.
.
#. HTN: Following resolution of hypotension (as above), pt was
restarted on home antihypertensives (lisinopril, metoprolol, and
amlodipine).
.
#. Anemia: Hct fell from 31 at admission to 22 in setting of
likely septic shock.  CT abdomen/pelvis did not reveal signs of
active bleed and HCT stabilized after transfuion of 3 units
pRBCS.  Patient was discharged with plan to continue monthly
outpatient Procrit injections.
.
INACTIVE
# GERD: Patient was continued on home omeprazole
.
TRANSITIONAL
1. Code status: Patient remained full code for the duration of
this admission
2. Pending: At time of discharge no labs were pending.
3. Transition of Care: Details of this admission were

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13859**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**].  You were admitted for pneumonia and an
irregular heart beat.  Your heart stopped beating and you
required cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  You were intubated to
help you breathe during treatment of your pneumonia.  You also
underwent placement of an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
(a fancy pacemaker that can shock you if your heart goes into a
strange rhythm).

You are now stable and ready for discharge.

During your hospitalization, the following changes were made to
your medications:
-STARTED cefpodoxime (to be continued until [**11-21**])
-STARTED azithromycin (to be continued until [**11-21**])

Cardiac Cath [**1-11**]:
PTCA COMMENTS: The patient was emergently brought to the
catheterization
lab after undergoing cardiac arrest thrice at an outlying
hospital and
again en route to our facility. The patient was resuscitated in
the
emergency room and then brought to the cath lab after consulting
with
family members. Initial angiogram demonstrated proximal total
occlusion of the proximal LAD. Prior to proceeding with
intervention a
40cc IABP was placed for hemodynamic support for during and post

procedure afterload reduction and diastolic augmentation via
standard
technique through the righ common femoral artery.
It was planned to treat the lesion with PTCA and stenting.
Integrelin
was the anticoagulant used during the procedure. A 6FXB LAD 3.5
guide
catheter provided optimal support. The lesion was crossed with a
Choice
PT XS wire into the distal vessel. The lesion was pre-dilated
with a 2.0
x 12 Voyager balloon at low inflation and a Quick Cat extraction

catheter was then advanced across the lesion twice due to the
presence
of thrombus. A 3.0 x 28 Vision BMS was then deployed at 16 ATM
and post
dilated with a 3.0 x 20 Quantum Maverick at 20 ATM. Final
angiography
demonstrated no residual stenosis and no angiographic evidence
of
dissection, thrombus or perforation with TIMI III flow in the
distal
vessel. Patient left the lab on pressor support with Dopamine,
IABP,
intubated and responsive only to painful stimuli.
Conclusions:
1. Succesful primary PTCA and stenting of the RLADwith aa 3.0
BMS with
prior thrombectomy. Post dilated with a 3.0 NC balloon. The
final
angiogram demonstrated no residual stenosis with no angiographic

evidence of dissection, embolization or perforation with TIMI
III flow
in the distal vessel with grade 2 blush.  (See PTCA comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Cardiogenic shock s/p cardiac arrest
2. Successful primary PCI of the LAD.
.
ECHO [**1-11**] - Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic  dysfunction with near akinesis of all
segments except for the basal half of the inferior and
inferiolateral walls which are hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w
proximal LAD/LM disease. Mild mitral regurgitation.
.
ECHO [**1-13**]: Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid to distal
anteroseptal/anterior/apical. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed. Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. No apical thrombus seen (cannot exclude). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac Cath [**1-15**]:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease due to sub-acute stent
thrombosis.
2. Severe elevation of right and left filling pressures.
3. AIVR and junctional tachycardia with drop in blood pressure
due to
rate and loss of syncrony.
4. Successful thrombetomy and angioplasty of a totally occluded
LAD with
restoration of TIMI 3 flow.
.
ECHO [**1-15**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis
of the septum, anterior wall and apex. Right ventricular
systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2162-1-13**], the overall LVEF is lower.
.
Echo [**1-18**]:
MEASUREMENTS:
EF 20% (nl >=55%)
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Cannot exclude LV
mass/thrombus.
Severely depressed LVEF.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior - akinetic; mid anterior - akinetic; basal
anteroseptal - akinetic; mid anteroseptal - akinetic; anterior
apex - akinetic; septal apex- akinetic; inferior apex -
akinetic; lateral apex - akinetic;
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
.
Conclusions:
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. A left ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include anteroseptal/anterior/apical
akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-1-15**],
there is no
significant change.
.
MRI/MRA Head [**1-20**]:
FINDINGS: There are scattered, ill-defined regions of restricted
diffusion in the right frontoparietal cortex and right occipetal
lobe, with corresponding T2 and FLAIR signal hyperintensity.
Combined with mild hypodensity on corresponding CT in these
regions, the findings suggest subacute infarction. No additional
areas of restricted diffusion are seen. There is a tiny,
solitary focus of susceptibility artifact in the left external
capsule most consistent with hemorrhagic residuum. No
intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally
midline structures are apparent.

There is mucosal thickening in maxillary sinuses, bilateral
scattered ethmoid air cells and bilateral sphenoid air cells,
possibly related to prior intubation or inflammatory process.
Fluid is also seen in bilateral mastoid air cells.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple right sided subacute infarcts in the right
frontoparietal and occipetal lobes - involvement of more than
one vascular territory suggests embolic phenomenon as the source
of infarction.
2. Sinus disease as described above.

MRA CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: The major tributaries of the Circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] are patent. There is no area of significant stenosis or
aneurysmal dilatation. The basilar artery is slightly narrowed
at its origin. Irregularity along the cavernous portions of
bilateral internal carotid arteries is most consistent with
atherosclerosis.

IMPRESSION: No significant stenosis identified.
.
CT Chest w/o contrast [**1-30**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: Soft tissue window images
demonstrate several prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, the
largest measuring 11 mm in short axis diameter in the right
peritracheal region (series 3, image 9) and a second prominent,
but nonenlarged 8 mm lymph node (series 3, image 17). The
prominent pretracheal lymph node (series 3, image 18) contains
fat, and is likely benign. There is also a prominent AP window
lymph node measuring 16 x 30 mm (series 3, image 20). There are
bilateral pleural effusions, which are simple in appearance and
Hounsfield unit density measurements. No pericardial effusion is
seen. A density is seen along the course of the LAD, suggesting
placement of prior stents. There is a right PICC, with the tip
positioned in the distal SVC.

Lung window images demonstrate scattered areas of ground-glass
opacity bilaterally, and areas of interlobular septal thickening
at the lung bases independently. No focal consolidation or areas
of cavitation are identified. No pneumothorax is seen.

On the limited images of the superior portion of the abdomen,
the patient is status post cholecystectomy. Within the left lobe
of the liver in a subcapsular position, there is a 3.8 x 2.2 cm
mass (series 2, image 48), which demonstrates density of 50
Hounsfield units on this noncontrast study. Adjacent to this,
there is a smaller focal area of low attenuation measuring 13 x
9 mm. The visualized portions of the adrenal glands, spleen,
pancreas, upper kidneys, and stomach are within normal limits.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified. Degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic
spine.

IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral pleural effusions, intralobular septal thickening,
and scattered areas of ground-glass opacity are consistent with
CHF and pulmonary volume overload. A superimposed atypical
infection is not entirely excluded. There is no evidence of
cavitation.

2. Several mildly prominent lymph nodes are noted within the
mediastinum, which can be seen in the setting of CHF and/or
infection.

3. There is a 3.8 cm subcapsular mass within the left lobe of
liver, which is not completely characterized on this study.
Further evaluation with an US or MRI is recommended.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 73 year old man who was transferred
from [**Hospital3 4107**] with an anterior STEMI complicated by
cardiogenic shock and VF arrest who was taken emergently to the
cath lab for revascularization, course complicated by in-stent
thrombosis and multiple extubations/re-intubations.
.
# CV:
CAD - Patient was transferred from OSH with STEMI, initially
loaded with plavix, acquired Vfib arrest resulting in multiple
rounds of CPR at OSH and enroute to [**Hospital1 **].  Patient transferred to
cath lab emergently (see results) with stent/iabp placement,
ECHO showing severe systolic dysfunction in anterior septal
region, LAD territory.  Heparin was held post-cath for concern
for UGI due to NGT lavage with coffee grounds in ED with small
drop in hct.  On HD#3, pt transferred to cath lab emergently for
ST elevations in anterior leads, found to have in-stent
thrombosis, thrombectomy and PTCA performed, IABP replaced,
heparin initiated, plavix loaded at 300mg, began 150mg qd.
Concern thrombosis [**3-12**] to inadequate plavix loading at OSH and
while in-house due to lavage and question of decreased PO
absorption.  Patient was continued on his aspirin, statin, and
plavix (75mg [**Hospital1 **]) and also heparin drip over the course of his
stay.  Two weeks post in-stent thrombosis, patient's heparin was
bridged with coumadin, with plan for continued anticoagulation.
Patient should also be continued on Plavix 75 mg PO BID for a
month and then uninterrupted for at least year and possible
longer.  The course at that point should be discussed with
patient's cardiologist.  Patient should continue his Lipitor 80
mg [**Last Name (LF) 244**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325, Digoxin 0.625 QD, Metoprolol XL 50 mg QD, and
Plavix 75 mg PO BID x 30 days and then 75 mg QD thereafer.
Patient's captopril 25 mg TID was also switched to Lisinopril 15
mg QD.
PUMP - patient found to have EF of 20% with
anteroseptal/anterior/apical akinesis, was aggressively diuresed
on 40 IV lasix and will be d/c on Lasix 20 PO along with
spiranolactone.  He should also be evaluated in [**5-14**] weeks for
SCD stratification with an echo, or alternatively, a signal
averaged EKG and cardiac MRI.
RHYTHM - Patient initially found to be in wide complex
tachycardia with VF arrest with subsequent afib/aflutter and
most recently with NSR with PAC.  Patient's amiodarone was d/c
due to concern for amiodarone toxicity and he was continued on
digoxin.  Patient will follow up in electrocardiology clinic.

# PULM: Patient's airway was initially preserved with intubation
and ventilator assistance in the setting of his cardiac code.
Patient self-extubated himself on the third hospital day, which
preceded his in-stent thrombosis and re-intubation.  Patient was
extubated one additional time with consequent reintubation, most
likely secondary to mucus plugging or decreased respiratory
drive due to remaining sedating medications.  As per history, no
intrinsic pulm disease was found to be limiting his pulmonary
functionality, RSBIs remained below 70 for days.  Patient was
initiall treated for an aspiration pneumonia and then
transitioned to treatment for hospital acquired pneumonia, see
ID discussion.  Due to some blood tinged sputum two weeks into
his hospital stay and abnormal findings on his chest  xray, a
pulmonary consult was placed, with the recommendations to defer
on bronchoscopy and following clinically.  On hospital day 16,
patient was successfully extubated without further complication
or reintubation.  Patient was subsequently diagnosed with MRSA
ventilation associated pneumonia as confirmed by [**1-27**] sputum.
He was treated with 13 days of Vancomycin which was switched to
Linezolid on [**1-30**] for a 7 day course.  Patient was also
empirically covered with Meropenem which was stopped after 7
days after no gram negative organisms were identified.  Patient
remained afebrile although his WBC was slow to improve and
remained [**12-23**] upon discharge.  Patient may have also had a
element of acute amiodarone toxicity which was contributing to
his continued oxygen requirement.  Patient will require further
Physical therapy, spirometry and gradual titration of his oxygen
demand.  Amiodarone as offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**] has been discontinued.
The infection is likely to be resolving as patient remained
afebrile without other source of leukocytosis.  Patient will
need two further days of linezolid.
.
# GI: On hosptial day 1, patient had coffee ground emesis on
nasogastric suctioning, which prompted holding patient's heparin
administration.  Protonix [**Hospital1 **] dosing was initiated.  Throughout
his stay, patient did not have any melanotic stools or overt
bleeding from his uppper GI tract.  While intubated, patient was
given tube feeds when appropriate, initially with increased
residuals, but then with improvement on an appropriate bowel
regimen.   His hematocrit remained stable upon discharge on
30-35.  He was conservatively managed.
.
# ID: Patient acquired a leukocytosis early in his hospital
course with a concurrent low grade temperature just below 100
degrees, save some intermittent spikes to 102.  Patient's
panculture initially returned negative, save diptheroids on a
blood culture.  Concern for aspiration pneumonia, patient was
initiated on levofloxacin and flagyl treatment.  Patient's
multiple sputum cultures returned as MRSA and patient was
treatment for a hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin,
concurrently with cefepime.  Due to woresning chest x-rays
during his course, infiltrative findings in the RLL and LML,
cefepime was changed to meropenem.  Patient was continued on
vancomycin, then linezolid and short course of meropemen as
above.  He remained afebrile throughout his stay without another
clear etiology of fevers.
.
# NEURO: Initially it was difficult to determine patient's
neurological functioning due to sedation.  As patient was being
intermittently weaned off sedation, there was question whether
patient was appropriately moving his extremities and responding
appropriately, which prompted an MRI, revealing watershed
infarcts vs emboli in the right frontoparietal and occipital
lobes.t delayed.  Continued concern for anoxic brain injury,
sequelae from notable infarcts on MRI, or more favorably,
lingering effects of sedating medications.  Patient continue to
improve as far as short term memory and recall, with
intermittent delusions which may have been due to his strokes
and improving ICU psychosis.  Patient was treated with Zyprexa
qHs and diazepam prn.
.
# f/u - patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
in [**Hospital **] clinic and with his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is being d/c to acute rehab.

Date of Birth:   [**2089-7-12**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CTU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old
male with no known medical or cardiac history who was found
down at a shopping mall.  CPR was initiated by a bystander
and the patient was found to be in ventricular fibrillation
arrest.  He was then subsequently cardioverted into sinus
rhythm but then went into a recurrent arrhythmia.  He was
subsequently shocked again into atrial fibrillation.  An
electrocardiogram at the time showed inferior ST segment
elevation as well as some lateral ST segment depression.  He
was then loaded on Amiodarone en route to the hospital.  He
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory via the outside hospital
Emergency Department.  Head CT was also negative at the
outside hospital.  At the catheterization laboratory, he was
found to have a totally occluded right coronary artery with
thrombus which was subsequently stented.  Also noted on the
catheterization laboratory report was a 30% discrete proximal
left anterior descending stenosis as well as a discrete 70-80%
hazy appearing left posterior descending artery stenosis.  The
patient also had a left dominant system.  Also of note, the
resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right sided
filling pressures consistent with acute right ventricular
myocardial infarction. Mean right atrial pressure was 20 mmHg and
the mean wedge was 25 mmHg.  His cardiac index was depressed as
well.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Inferior ST segment myocardial infarction - As noted, the
patient had an inferior ST segment myocardial infarction with
right ventricular infarction.  He underwent stenting of the RCA
acutely, and subsequent repeat atheterization 2 days later
with intervention on the left posterior descending artery lesion.
The patient was started on Aspirin and Plavix during his
admission.   He was also started on a beta blocker and was
discharged on 50 mg p.o. twice a day of Metoprolol.  An
echocardiogram was also performed which showed an ejection
fraction of greater than 60% and also showed a mildly dilated
left atrium and a moderately dilated right atrium.  There was
also noted to be mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy but
normal left ventricular cavity size and left ventricular systolic
function was normal. There was 1+ tricuspid regurgitation noted
and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  Also on the
echocardiogram, it was also read that one could not exclude
mild focal basal and inferior hypokinesis as well as focal
right ventricular wall hypokinesis.  The patient did not have
any subsequent ectopy during his hospital stay and his
antiarrhythmics were eventually weaned.

2.  Neurologic - As mentioned, the patient had a head CT
performed at the outside hospital which was normal.  The
patient also had a CT of the cervical spine performed while
at [**Hospital1 69**] and this did not show
any evidence of fracture or subluxation.  Once the patient
was extubated, the patient's neck was cleared clinically.
The patient initially came to the hospital intubated and
sedated as he had arrested.  The patient was subsequently
weaned off intubation.  During the first few days of his
hospital course, his short term memory was noted to be
impaired, but this improved greatly throughout the remainder of
his hospital course.

3.  Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, Oxacillin
resistant - The patient spiked a fever in the early part of
his hospital course and was noted to have fever to
approximately 102.  Blood cultures were done and showed three
out of six bottles growing multiple morphologies of
Staphylococcus epidermidis.  One of the isolates was noted to
be Oxacillin resistant.  The patient was seen by the
infectious disease team in house and was started on
Vancomycin one gram intravenously q12hours.  The patient was
eventually discharged with a PICC line and his Vancomycin is
scheduled to be completed on [**2148-5-16**].

4.  Elevated liver function tests - The patient was noted to
have elevated liver function tests during his hospital
course.  He had a peak AST of 127 and a peak ALT of 118.  The
main differential diagnosis was shock liver versus congestive
hepatitis from right ventricular infarct versus possible
statin induced toxicity.  The patient had been started on
Lipitor during his hospital course but this was eventually
held due to the rising liver enzymes.  A CT of the abdomen
was performed to rule out liver abscess as the patient was
bacteremic from Staphylococcus epidermidis.  This did not
show any acute intra-abdominal abnormalities.  Also ordered
at the time was a hepatitis panel.  The hepatitis surface
antigen was pending at the time of this dictation as well as
hepatitis C antibody.  These will be followed up as an
outpatient.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Inferior ST segment elevated myocardial infarction.
2.  Right ventricular infarction.
3.  Ventricular fibrillation arrest.
4.  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent
of right coronary artery and left circumflex.
5.  Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, Oxacillin
resistant.
6.  Elevated liver function tests, question statin toxicity
versus congestive hepatitis.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  He was scheduled to follow-up with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] within four weeks of discharge.  He also
has an appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3197**] on [**2148-5-7**], as
well as with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] on [**2148-6-17**].  He is also to
follow-up for the Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia.  In
addition he should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his PCP.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Paxil 20 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Vancomycin one gram intravenously q12hours for eighteen
days, the course is to end on [**2148-5-16**].
6.  Nitroglycerin tablets p.r.n.

The patient is also scheduled to have weekly laboratory draws
to check complete blood count, Chem7, liver function tests
and Vancomycin trough and these laboratory results will be
sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].  He was also discharged on a cardiac
heart healthy diet.

TTE ([**12-20**]):
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20-25 %). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severely depressed
biventricular systolic function.

.
Cardiac cath ([**12-26**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA did not have
significant
coronary artery disease. The LAD was calcified with a mid-vessel
80%
stenosis involving D1. The D1 had a proximal 50% and a
mid-vessel 80%
stenosis. The LCx had a proximal 50-60% lesion and was calcified
in the
mid-segment. The OM1 was large and bifurcating. The RCA was
subtotally
occluded in the mid vessel and distally filled via left to right

collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated
left
ventricular filling pressure (LVEDP 15 mm Hg) and normal
systemic
arterial blood pressure (SBP 125 mm Hg). There was no gradient
upon
pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred due to renal dysfunction.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mildly elevated left ventricular filling pressure.
.
EKG [**12-19**]:

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 9241**] is a 78M with CAD, HTN, HL, PVD presenting s/p VF
arrest, with coffee ground emesis and guaiac+ stool.

#.  V fib arrest:  The etiology was unclear on admission.  Has
known history of CAD.  Cardiac enzymes were slightly elevated
after defibrillation, and not suggestive of primary coronary
ishemic event.  [**Month (only) 116**] also be scar mediated from prior MI.  He
underwent arctic sun cooling protocol. One day after warming,
sedation was weaned and he was following commands.  He was
extubated 3 days after the arrest but required BiPap shortly
thereafter.  He was evaluated by cardiac cath and subsequently
by EP for ICD placement. Cath showed 3 vessel disease with
mildly elevated LV filling pressure. ICD was placed on [**2191-12-26**]
without complication. He did not have any subsequent events. Pt
is completing a 3-day post-operative course of Keflex (last day
[**2191-12-29**].He will be discharged to rehab with follow-up for his ICD
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
# Coronaries:  Given the possibility that cardiomyopathy was
ischemic in origin, he was placed on a statin, beta blocker, and
ASA.  He underwent diagnostic cardiac cath which showed 3-vessel
disease. He will be discharged on low-dose Lisinopril,
Metoprolol, Simvastatin, and Aspirin 81. He will be following up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for general cardiology. He will be evaluated for
possible surgical intervention with cardiothoracic surgery as
outpt, but he is likely not a good candidate.
.
# Pump:  Patient had known cardiomyopathy, with TTE showed EF
20% with both systolic and diastolic CHF.  Despite this, he did
not initially appear overloaded and was oxygenating well.  After
resuscitation, he was overloaded and was diuresed with lasix.
ACEI was not started initially given concern for GI bleed. He
required several doses of PRN Lasix 60mg IV during his stay for
tachypnea. He required a dose of Lasix 40mg IV x 1 during his
ICD placement for tachypnea to the 30s. He has also responded to
nebs given his underlying COPD. He has been satting in the mid
to upper 90s on 2L, and upper 80s-low 90s on RA (according to
physical therapy.) He was not previously on home O2. He will be
discharged on standing Lasix 20mg PO daily, and O2 will be
weaned as tolerated to maintain O2sats >92%.
.
# Atrial fibrillation:  After initially presenting with VF, he
was in and out of atrial fibrillation.  Metoprolol was
uptitrated for rate control. He will be discharged on
Metoprolol 75mg PO tid. HR was stable in the 60s on day of
discharge. He was also maintained on a heparin gtt during his
hospital stay. This was held in preparation for his ICD
placement. The morning after the procedure, he was started on
Coumadin 5mg PO daily for anti-coagulation in the setting of
afib (so does not require heparin bridge.) Dosing should be
adjusted to maintain an INR of [**12-27**].
.
# GI bleed:  Patient initially had coffee-ground emesis and
guiac positive stool.  His hematocrit fell from 33 to 27, but he
did not require transfusion.  CT was negative for aorto-enteric
fistula. The GI team did an EGD and found gastritis and
duodenitis without source of bleed. He was given proton pump
inhibitor [**Hospital1 **] initially, and this was transitioned to 40mg PO
daily. He did not have any recurrent signs of bleed. On day of
discharge, his crit was stable at 28.5. His anemia should be
followed up as outpt with his PCP.
.
# Transaminitis:  On admission, patient had macrocytosis,
transaminitis, thrombocytopenia. Per conversation with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
was new.  He has no prior history of liver disease. The most
likely cause of transaminitis was underperfusion in the setting
of shock. INR/albumin were normal on admit. Transaminases
continued to trend down toward normal throughout his stay. LFTs
should be re-checked as outpt with PCP.
.
# Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets were low but stable during stay.
Levels fluctuated between 60s-low 100s. Pt did not require any
transfusions, and did not show new signs of bleeding. Platelet
levels should be followed up further as outpatient to evaluate
for underlying hematologic derangement.
.
# COPD: Pt had episodes of tachypnea during his stay which was
thought to be related to both fluid overload following
resuscitation and his underlying COPD. He was maintained on nebs
as needed (which he responded well to) and resumed on Advair at
discharge. He required supplemental O2, and was satting in the
mid-upper 90s on 2L on day of discharge. He was also started on
standing Lasix 20mg PO daily to address the component of fluid
overload.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 YOM with history of type I DM, HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
and ischemic cardiomyopathy who presents after VFib arrest. Over
the last several weeks has several episodes of dizzy clammy
feelings with normal blood sugars. Has otherwise been healthy
and active. He was at the mall this evening with his wife. [**Name (NI) **]
was feeling fine. He told his wife suddenly that he needed to
sit down. He then quickly passed out, hitting the back of his
head on the ground. Bystanders preformed CPR. When EMS arrived
he was found to be in polymorphic VT. He was shocked at 7pm and
became asystolic. He was given epi/atopine and returned to a
narrow complex rhythm. He was intubated and taken to an OSH. At
the OSH, head CT was reportedly negative. He was started on an
amiodarone dirp and transferred by med flight to [**Hospital1 18**] for
futher care.
.
In our ED, his initial vitals wereHR 103, BP 118/63 satting 100%
on FiO2 100%. He was started on a heparin gtt. He was given
versed for aggitation on the vent and had a CT scan of his c
spine. He also had a 1.5 cm laceration on the back of his head
stapled.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU. Patient was stable. Neuro was consulted
for question of status epilepticus vs myoclonus. A right
subclavian central line and a left A line were placed. He was
started an artic sun cooling blanket at 12am.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 49 YOM with known CAD/CM who presents after v fib
arrest.
.
1) CAD/V fib arrest:  Patient collapsed in mall and was found to
be in vfib when EMS arrived.  He received bystander CPR with
estimated time between collapse and EMS arrival of 15 minutes.
Was shocked and became asystolic and then was given epi/atropine
and returned to narrow complex rhythm.  Has h/o CAD s/p 4 vessel
CABG and ischemic cardiomyopathy. EKG done afterwards did not
look ischemic, however may have had acute occlusion of one of
his grafts causing his arrythmia without EKG findings currently.
Had signs of anoxic brain injury on arrival to the CCU including
myoclonus and posturing which are poor prognostic indicators.
Neurology was consulted. He was loaded with IV valproic acid for
sz ppx and placed on versed drip. Given the patient had an
[**Hospital 105124**] hospital arrest and he was within 6 hours of his
arrest the decision was made to treat with therapeutic
hypothermia to reduce cerebral metabolic needs. He was placed on
Vecuronium to reduce shivering during the cooling process. He
was cooled down to 89 degrees for 18 hours per protocol and then
slowly rewarmed.  Given the possibility of an ischemic event he
was placed on IV heparin and continued on ASA.  He had been
started on amiodarone prior to arrival which was stopped due to
prolonged QT interval.  He was continued on BB which was
uptitrated.
.
2) Resp:  Patient was intubated in the field for airway
protection.  Has no history of lung disease.  Was found to have
an aspiration PNA which was treated as below.  During the
hospitalization he did not tolerate his ETT, specifically, when
attempting to wean him off of sedation he would cough violently
and become very agitated.  Given his poor neurologic status and
likely need for prolonged intubation Interventional Pulmonology
was consulted regarding trach placement.  A trach was placed on
[**4-26**].  He continued to have a strong cough despite anesthetics
and cough suppressants.  He was changed to PS ventilation and
tolerated this well and was then weaned to trach mask.  With
improvement in his PNA he was able to be weaned to NC and his
trach was capped.
.
3) DM: Normally on inuslin pump at home. Sugars initially
elevated to 400 with gap acidosis. Likely DKA in setting of
arrest and no insulin pump. Bolused with 1L NS and placed on
insulin gtt. His anion gap resolved and he was maintained on the
insulin gtt for tight glucose control.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for
assistance in transition to SC insulin.  Once TFs were
stabilized he was switched to Glargine and RISS.  His
long-acting insulin was uptitrated to 50U to be given at
lunchtime daily.
.
4) Renal insufficency - On admission the patient's Cr was
slightly elevated to 1.3. Etiology was likely poor perfusion in
setting of cardiac arrest. His Cr returned to baseline and
remained stable.
.
5) Fever: Patient developed high fevers on HD#2 up to 102.
Initially felt to be either central fevers vs. infection,
however he then developed bandemia suggestive of acute
infection.  He was pan-cultured.  CXR was consistant with either
aspiration pneumonitis vs. PNA so he was started on ceftriaxone
and flagyl.  Sputum culture grew out pan-sensitive Klebsiella so
his flagyl was discontinued.  He had recurrent fevers a week
into treatment and was recultured.  CXR showed worsening of his
PNA and given the concern for hospital acquired pathogens and
VAP his antibiotics were broadened to vanc/zosyn.  Repeat sputum
culure grew out MSSA and the vanco was discontinued.  All urine
and blood cultures were NGTD. Zosyn, which was started on
[**2190-4-27**], needs to be continued for a total of two weeks.
.
6) FEN: NPO initially given patient was paralyzed.  TFs were
initiated and PEG was placed [**4-26**] for permanant feeding.
.
7) PPX: heparin gtt transiently, then heparin sc, PPI
.
8) Access: R subclavian, left A line
.
9) Code: DNR/I

13541,Survived,"Admission Date:  [**2174-1-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2174-2-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2111-9-4**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
male who had developed some shortness of breath and dyspnea
on exertion over the past week to months prior to admission
who went into cardiac arrest.  He was found to be in
ventricular tachycardia in the field by Emergency Medical
Service.  He had shocks times three and 1 mg of epinephrine.
En route to outside hospital, the patient went into
ventricular fibrillation and had additional shocks time three
as well as epinephrine.  The patient went into ventricular
tachycardia.

The patient was brought to the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital Emergency
Department.  An arterial blood gas at that time showed
7.11/31/66 with multiple rhythms on telemetry and
electrocardiogram including ventricular tachycardia,
ventricular fibrillation, sinus tachycardia with variable
atrioventricular conduction.  The patient received
procainamide 900 intravenously and was shocked multiple
times.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] where a temporary wire was placed at the right
internal jugular.

The patient was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory.  The
patient had a total of greater than 20 shocks.  Pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 45, right atrial pressure was
40, and there was a 30% occlusion of the left main coronary
artery, a 50% occlusion of the mid left anterior descending
artery, and a total occlusion of the left circumflex, and
total occlusion of the right carotid artery.

The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft in
[**2170**] with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending artery and radial to the obtuse marginal.  The
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery was patent, and the radial to the obtuse marginal was
patent.  There was a 70% left subclavian stenosis and a 70%
to 80% first obtuse marginal stenosis.  Arterial and
ventricular temporary pacing wires were placed.  The patient
was placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump.  The patient
arrived to the floor with intravenous amiodarone and
nitroglycerin drips.

On the floor, the patient became hypotensive.  Nitroglycerin
was stopped.  Pulmonary artery diastolics were 18.  Numbers
revealed a cardiac index of 1.4 with the intra-aortic balloon
pump in place.  The patient was started on fluids.
Dobutamine was started.

A STAT bedside echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of
20% and an old inferior scar.  No valvular abnormalities.

The patient was seen by the Electrophysiology Service who
changed him from ventricular pacing to atrial pacing and
ventricularly sensed.  His blood pressure dramatically
improved with this change.  The patient was observed in the
Coronary Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post 2-vessel coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2170**].
2.  Peripheral vascular disease.
3.  Aortic aneurysm repair in [**2171**].
4.  Status post aortobifemoral in [**2171**].
5.  Status post left carotid endarterectomy.
6.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his brother and is
fully functional at baseline.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Coronary artery disease:
The patient had patent grafts and diffuse disease.  He was
continued on aspirin and Lipitor.  His beta blocker and ACE
inhibitor were added back and titrated to maximal effect as
tolerated by the patient's blood pressure.

(b)  Pump:  An initial showed an ejection fraction of 20%,
old inferior wall hypokinesis, and akinesis.  Initially, the
patient's cardiac index was noted to be 1.4 while on the
intra-aortic balloon pump.  The index went up to 2.1 with
dobutamine and atrioventricular pacing.

A repeat echocardiogram performed on [**2174-2-2**] showed
left ventricular cavity moderately dilated, overall left
ventricular function systolic function was severely
depressed, with an ejection fraction of 30%.  Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities including basilar inferior
akinesis and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis, mild
anteroseptal hypokinesis/akinesis, and mid to distal anterior
hypokinesis.  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion were normal.  The aortic valve leaflets were normal.
The mitral valve was mildly thickened.  There was trivial
mitral regurgitation was seen.  The left ventricular systolic
function was improved from the initial echocardiogram on
[**2174-1-28**].

(c)  Rhythm:  The patient is status post ventricular
fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia prolonged arrest
with prolonged resuscitation efforts, likely from old scar
formation.  The patient had improved acidemia and was
followed by the Electrophysiology Service throughout his
hospital course.

On [**1-29**], the patient had one episode of ventricular
tachycardia.  He was shocked with resolution and was placed
on amiodarone.

On [**2-1**], the patient went for electrophysiology
mapping.  They were unable to induce ventricular tachycardia
at that time.

The patient went for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
placement on [**2-3**] with no complications.

The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone was checked as he
was started on amiodarone.  Thyroid-stimulating hormone was
notable at 38.  The patient should have this followed by his
primary care physician as an outpatient considering
amiodarone use.

His aspartate aminotransferase was 91.  His
alanine-aminotransferase was 58.  The patient had pulmonary
function tests performed prior to discharge for a baseline
pulmonary status on amiodarone.  Forced vital capacity was
1.64 (41% of predicted), FEV1 was 1.34 (48% of predicted),
and FEV1: FVC ratio was 82 (115% of predicted).

2.  ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  The patient has a history of diabetes.
He had high fingerstick blood glucose levels with ketones.
The patient was initially placed on an insulin drip which was
weaned off, and he was transitioned back to his regular
diabetes medications and insulin sliding-scale.

3.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was extubated on [**1-31**] without complications.

4.  RENAL ISSUES:  The patient was initially noted to be in
acute renal failure with creatinine levels as high as 2.3 on
[**2174-1-29**].  Over the course of his hospital stay, the
patient's creatinine trended down to his baseline of 1.6
prior to discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
pacemaker placement.
2.  Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation
arrest.
3.  Status post prolonged resuscitation.
4.  Congestive heart failure.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 80 year old man with history of coronary artery
disease status post CABG and stent, systolic congestive heart
failure, and stage 4 chronic renal insufficiency who was
admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit after presenting to
the emergency room after cardiac arrest.  He was at home today
when his wife heard a loud thump, and he was found down
unresponsive in the kitchen with the refrigerator door open with
his Procrit in his hand.  The wife [**Name (NI) 653**] 911 and then called
her daughter who lives close by. His daughter is CPR certified
and arrived within 5-10 minutes and started CPR. EMS arrived a
few minutes later. The patient was pulseless, and leads attached
demonstrated monomorphic VT. He was cardio-verted with a shock,
with return of a pulse. He was intubated in the field and
lidocaine drip was started. A systolic blood pressure in the
70's was recorded.
.
In the emergency room he was initiated on the Arctic Sun cooling
protocol. A right internal juglar central venous line was
placed. He was hypotensive with a systolic pressure in the 70's,
and dopamine 5mcg/kg/min was started. He was reportedly
minimally responsive with some movement at that time.

.
[**2105-5-12**]: Transthoracic Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 30-40 %). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2105-1-13**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
slightly lower.
.
[**2105-5-14**]: CT C-Spine without contrast
IMPRESSION:
Moderately severe DJD. No definite fracture. If there is concern
for
ligamentous injury, MRI is recommended. There is a 6.6-mm
possible nodule in the left lung apex which is only seen on one
image. Recommend further evaluation with CT of the chest.
.
[**2105-5-16**] Renal Ultrasound:
RENAL SON[**Name (NI) **]: The right kidney measures 10.4 cm. The left
kidney measures 11.0 cm. No stone, hydronephrosis, or mass is
identified. There is a simple cyst within the lower pole of the
left kidney measuring approximately 1.5 cm, not significantly
changed from [**2105-1-15**].
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis
.
[**2105-5-21**] Chest X-Ray
IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution but no overt
pulmonary edema.
2. Apparent elevation of right hemidiaphragm, probably due to
subpulmonic
right effusion, but right lateral decubitus chest radiograph may
be considered for confirmation if warranted clinically.
Persistent small left effusion.

[**2105-5-23**] CHEST PA AND LATERAL
Pacer/ICD device has been placed with leads terminating in the
right atrium and right ventricle, and no pneumothorax. Right
PICC line has been withdrawn, and now terminates in the superior
right axillary region lateral to the right second rib. Cardiac
silhouette remains enlarged, and a moderate-sized right pleural
effusion appears slightly larger. Small left pleural effusion is
unchanged. Upper zone vascular redistribution is present, but no
overt pulmonary edema is evident. Atelectatic changes persist in
the right mid and both lower lung zones.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest: Patient was without
spontaneous circulation for approximately 10 minutes, possibly
longer. CPR was started within 5-10 minutes after his daughter
arrived. It is unclear if the patient was in a perfusing rhythm
prior to the arrival of assistance. His [**Location (un) 2611**] Coma scale on
arrival to the emergency department was 5, and the Arctic Sun
Cooling protocl initiated. It is difficult to exclude an acute
ischemic event but the monomorphic ventricular tachycarida on
rhythm strip and known history of coronary artery disease was
suggestive of a scar-mediated arrhythmic sudden cardiac death.
.
Patient tolerated the Arctic Sun Cooling protocol well.
Paralytics were used only for induction of the cooling, and he
appeared comfortable on sedation for the 24 hours of cooling.
Electrolytes, CK, lactate, coagulation studies, and serial
arterial blood gases were monitored while he was cooled.
.
As he was warmed after completing the cooling protocol, he
demonstrated purposeful movements and responded appropriately to
commands by moving all extremities. He was able to be
successfully extubated on [**2105-5-13**]. His C-spine was cleared and
his hard collar was removed.
.
Patient initally demonstrated some cognitive deficits,
especially in short term memory, however these improved greatly
during his stay. Physical and occupational therapy worked with
the patient, and he was eventually felt to be safe for discharge
home with continued home physical therapy.
.
In regards to his arrhythmia, he did have another episode of
ventricular tachycardia on evening after he was extubated for
approximately 2 1/2 minutes. During this time he was
asymptomatic and his blood pressure remained stable. He was
started on intravenous amiodarone at that time and transitioned
to an oral regimen. Three days after starting amiodarone, it was
noted that his liver function tests (AST, ALT, LDH and total
bilirubin) had markedly increased; this was felt to be secondary
to initiation of amiodarone, so it was discontinued. His liver
function tests trended downward immediately after cessation of
the amiodarone.
.
Based on his presentation, low ejection fraction, and event
noted on telemetry, decision was made to place a defibrillator
(ICD) to protect against any further events. ICD placement was
deferred until the patient's renal function demonstrated
improvement, and was ultimately placed on [**2105-5-22**]. He will
complete a short course of prophylatic antibiotics and follow up
in device clinic in one week, as well as in one month to check
the device.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated in the field. It
was initially it was felt that the patient had evidence of
congestive heart failure, however on [**2105-5-12**] he had an episode
of hypoxia. A chest x-ray at that time revealed RUL/RML collapse
secondary to mucous plugging which likely caused the acute
hypoxic event, which was responsive to suction. He was started
on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage (Vancomycin and Zosyn)
given concerns over possible pneumonia based on imaging studies
and hypotension. His hypoxia resolved and patient was
successfully extubated. Initially he was diuresed, however
appeared euvolemic during the remainder of his stay without need
for further diuresis. He completed a course of antibiotic
treatment for pneumonia, with sputum cultures ultimately
demonstrating stenotrophomonas maltophilia. He had no further
respiratory complaints and continued to have a normal oxygen
saturation on room air.
.
# Coronary artery disease: It was not suspected that inciting
event was ischemic in nature. His cardiac enzymes were followed
and remained flat (peak 0.10 troponin, CK 175). His EKGs were
consistent with his prior EKGs, without any findings concerning
for acute ischemia. He had no symptoms of ischemia during his
stay. His home medications of metoprolol (although at a lower
dose) and aspirin were continued. His statin was also
re-started, however this was held due to the increase his liver
function tests.
* His statin can likely be re-started at his outpatient
follow-up visit with his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
cardiologist, provided that his liver function tests have
returned to baseline.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation and is on chronic anticoagulation for this. During
his stay, his rhythm alternated mainly between atrial
fibrillation and a junctional rhythm. His coumadin was initially
held given a supratherapeutic INR. He was given vitamin K for an
increasing INR while undergoing cooling protocol. He was kept on
a heparin drip during his stay while decisions were being made
regarding placement of a defibrillator or other interventions.
After his defibrillator was placed, he was re-started on his
home doses of coumadin (2.5 mg all days except 5 mg on Tuesday).
Rate control was acheived by metoprolol 25 mg twice a day
(decreased from home dose of 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
* He will need an INR/PT/PTT check on Tuesday, [**5-26**], to
follow his INR (followed by his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name (STitle) 1395**]. He will then resume his usual INR checks per his primary
provdier.
.
# Hypotension: Patient initially presented with hypotension
after his arrest and required pressor support. He was kept on a
dopamine drip, started in the emergency room, until he was able
to be weaned 1-2 days later. It was felt his hypotension may
have been secondary to his arrest. He had no evidence of adrenal
insufficiency. He was treated with antibiotics for his pneumonia
as well.
His home medication of metoprolol was re-started and his blood
pressure was at goal at time of discharge.
.
# Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Patient, per report
from family and outpatient cardiologist, was functioning well
prior to his cardiac arrest. He was initially diuresed prior to
extubation, as he had received a large amount of intravenous
fluids while in the emergency room. During his stay, he
continued to appear euvolemic. His home diuretics (torsemide and
chlorothiazide) were held during his stay for this reason, as
well as his renal insufficiency and initially poor urine output.
 He was autodiuresing prior to discharge.  The 24 hours prior to
discharge he was negative 1 liter; he was asymptomatic and
saturating >97% on room air.  Given the increasing size of the
right pleural effusion upon discharge, he will likely need
diuresis soon; however, the administration of diuretics must be
delicately balanced with his renal insufficiency until his renal
function returns to baseline (Creatinine ~3).
*He was instructed to weigh himself daily, limit his sodium
intake to 2 grams daily, and to monitor for signs of heart
failure (dyspnea, peripheral edema, etc.).  A VNA was also
arranged to go to his home and measure daily oxygen saturations
and weights.  He was instructed to contact his physician if he
became symptomatic prior to reporting to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] for his
appointment on [**6-25**] for renal followup; his VNA was also
his oxygen saturation decreased below 93%.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Patient was treated with lantus and a
humalog sliding scale. He will need continued titration of his
regimen on an outpatient basis.
.
# Renal Failure: Patient has chronic stage 4 renal
insufficiency. His creatinine was initially at baseline during
his first few days, however his creatinine then began to rise
while he concurrently became oliguric. The renal team was
consulted, and it was suspected that the patient had ATN
secondary to his circulatory arrest and hypotension. His urine
sediment further supported this. His creatinine peaked at 5.5,
and was trending downward at time of discharge. It was felt that
his renal function would continue to improve, and that he had no
indications for dialysis. A renal ultrasound was unremarkable.
* Patient will need basic electrolyte panel, including BUN and
creatinine, checked on Tuesday [**5-26**], to be followed by his
outpatient nephrologist. He will be closely followed after
discharge by his outpatient renal team.
.
# Anemia: Patient has history of chronic anemia and is on
Procrit as an outpatient. He was given one unit of packed red
blood cells during his stay to help replete volume and improve
his hematocrit. His hematocrit remained stable during his stay,
ranging mainly in the 24-26 range. While on the heparin drip, he
had mild epistaxis and bruising, but otherwise had no evidence
of bleeding.
.
# Code: Patient remained full code during his admission.
.
# Disposition: Physical therapy and occupational therapy both
felt patient was safe for discharge home, where he could
continue to work towards returning to his baseline with home
physical therapy. Discussions were held with the family to
stress the importance of continued activity upon return home.
Patient will have close follow up with his nephrologist, primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] cardiologist, all of whom were aware of
patient's hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit after
having a cardiac arrest at home. You were cooled under the
Arctic Sun Protocol and initially intubated. You did well post
extubation, with some cognitive deficits and worsening renal
function.  Upon discharge, you were functioning mentally near
baseline, and your renal function was improving.  A
defibrillator was placed to prevent further dangerous continued
arrhythmias.
.
Please weigh yourself every morning, and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1395**] if you note a weight gain of more than 3 lbs. Please
call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1395**], or go to the emergency room if
you experience any chest pain, palpitations, difficulty
breathing, bleeding, swelling or redness at site of
defibrillator insertion, firing of your defibrillator, decreased
or no urination, or other concerning symptoms.
Please follow a low salt diet, with no more salt than 2 grams
daily.
.
Please continue to work with physical therapy and ambulate
frequently, at least several times a day to maintain your
strength.
.
A few medication changes have been made:
- Torsemide has been stopped. This medication has been stopped
due to your renal function being worse than your baseline.  As
you renal function recovers, it will be important to restart
this medication after discussing this with your physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
is important to understand that this medication helps rid your
body of excess fluid due to chronic systolic congestive heart
failure, or decreased pumping ability of your heart.  If you
develop symptoms of shortness of breath, inability to lie flat
due to shortness of breath, swelling in your feet or ankles, or
shortness of breath with exertion, please contact your physician
as these are signs of excess fluid which may be affecting your
lungs and other organs.  You will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] (your kidney
doctor) on Thursday, [**5-28**].  It is also recommended that you
followup with your PCP prior to this, if possible, so he can
monitor your volume status as well.  Also, please weigh yourself
daily as described above and notify your physician if you gain
>3 pounds in one day as this may be a sign of fluid
gain/overload.
- Rouvastatin has been stopped, this can likely be re-started at
follow up once your liver function tests are checked.
- Metoprolol has been decreased to 25 mg twice a day.
- Glargine (also called Lantus) has been decreased to 12 units
daily.
- Chlorothiazide has been stopped.
- Potassium (Klor-con powder) has been stopped due to your
worsened renal failure.
- Continue Keflex antibiotics as prescribed to complete a 3 day
course after your pacemaker was placed.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, this is a 74 yr old with relatively
unremarkable past medical history who went into V.Fib arresst at
home and was shocked out of rhythm by EMS in field. After
stabilzation of pt. in the [**Name (NI) **], pt. found to have pumonary
embolism and ?pneumonia/increased WBC. He was started on Heparin
for the PE and abx for increased WBC. PNA. Pt. remained
intubated until [**6-5**] when he was successfully extubated. During
this time ([**Date range (1) 56879**]) pt was followed by medicine, cardiology,
nutrition, etc. and had numerous studies performed
(CXRs,CTs,Cultures-blood,urine,sputum,Echos,etc.). Finally on
[**2190-6-7**] pt underwent a cardiac cath which revealed severe LMCA
and mult. vessel disease. An IABP was placed and pt was
scheduled for a CABG the next day. On [**6-8**] pt was brought to the
OR and underwent a CABG x 3. Pt. tolerated the procedure well
with a total bypass time of 65 minutes and cross-clamp time of
54 minutes. Please see op note for full surgical details. Pt was
transferred to CSRU in stable condition with a MAP of 85, CVP
16, PAD 16, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] 23, and HR 88 A-paced. He was being titrated on
Neo and propofol. Later on op day pt was weaned from mechanical
ventilation and propofol and was succesfully extubated. He was
awake, alert, mae, and following commands. POD #1 pt's IABP was
removed. Neo was weaned and diuretics and b-blockers were
started per protocol. He was started back on Heparin and
Coumadin. On POD #2 his chest tubes, epicardial pacing wires,
and foley catheter were all removed per protocol. POD #[**1-28**] pt
with ?aspiration. Speech study performed showed thin liquid
aspiration. Remained in the CSRU until POD#4 when he was
transferred to telemetry floor. Cont. to have course bs bilat.
Pt. encouraged to get OOB and ambulate. POD #[**4-30**] pt cont. to
progress slow d/t ambulation limitationa from polio. He was
cont. on Heparin and Coumadin for PE/A.Fib and Vanco for asp.
PNA. POD #7 pt was doing well, but needed transfer to Rehab
before going home. He was transferred there on heparin,
coumadin, and vanco. His physical exam was much improved with 1+
edema and irregular rate and heart rhythm. Appropriate follow-up
appointments were made.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old
African-American male patient who is well known to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit team from a recent lengthy
admission, who was discharged the morning prior to this
readmission to [**Hospital6 13846**] facility.  The
patient had been in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
treatment of multiple medical problems from [**8-28**] to
[**2139-10-6**].  Events during that hospital stay included
treatment for respiratory failure, renal insufficiency of
unclear etiology (dialysis dependent), lower extremity
bilateral elephantiasis and enterococcal bacteremia, herpes
zoster infection, pulmonary hypertension, and upper
gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient was ultimately
stabilized and had a tracheostomy placed on [**9-15**] for
failure to wean from the ventilator.  A PEG tube was also
placed, but the patient was able to take p.o. by the time of
previous discharge.  Of note, the patient also had known
diastolic and right-sided heart failure with an ejection
fraction of greater than 55%, and dilated right ventricle.

According to the Emergency Medical Service records and
report, as well as the Emergency Room Department, and a
written record from [**Hospital3 672**], the patient was
transported to [**Hospital3 672**] on the afternoon of this
admission, was conversant and stable until transferred to
flat bed from ambulance stretcher.  On transfer, the patient
apparently suffered an acute respiratory decompensation, and
Emergency Medical Service staff was unable to ventilate him.
A large mucous plug was subsequently removed from the
tracheostomy insert and respirations were restarted
successfully; although the patient became acutely bradycardic
and a cardiac arrest code was called.  According to the
physician notes, the patient was unresponsive from the time
of the respiratory distress, and the patient was pulseless
when a code was called.  The patient was found to be in
pulseless electrical activity, and cardiopulmonary
resuscitation was begun.  The patient then received
epinephrine times 1 mg and atropine times 1 mg and converted
to ventricular tachycardia which normalized to pulsatile
sinus tachycardia.  An arterial blood gas was done and found
to be 7.107/80/72 on 87% oxygen saturation.  The patient
never regained responsiveness and was noted to have total
left-sided hemiparesis, doll's eyes, and purposeless
right-sided movements.  The patient was immediately
transferred back to [**Hospital1 69**] for
readmission and evaluation.

In the Emergency Room the patient was unresponsive with
arbitrary right-sided arm movements and withdrew to pain on
the right lower extremity only.  There was no sign of verbal
communication or auditory understanding.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Obesity.
 2.  Obstructive sleep apnea.
 3.  Status post tracheostomy.
 4.  Hypertension.
 5.  Pulmonary hypertension.
 6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 7.  Cor pulmonale.
 8.  Chronic renal insufficiency, on hemodialysis.
 9.  Lower extremity venous ulcers.
10.  Dilated right ventricle and right heart failure.
11.  Status post upper gastrointestinal bleed.
12.  Lower extremity edema/elephantiasis.
13.  Status post enterococcal bacteremia.
14.  Herpes zoster.
15.  Gastric ulcer.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to KEFLEX and OXACILLIN.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a history of cerebrovascular
accidents in his brother and his sister.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of remote cocaine
and marijuana.  The patient quit 10 years ago.  The patient
also has a 15-pack-year history of tobacco use.  The patient
is married and lives with his wife previously.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Please see previous Discharge
Summary from [**2139-10-6**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile,
pulse of 75, blood pressure of 122/53, respirations of 19,
oxygen saturation 96% on 50% tracheostomy mask.  Generally,
the patient had purposeless movement of the right upper
extremity, in respiratory distress, wide opened injected
sclerae.  HEENT was significant for dry blood in the
oropharynx, tracheostomy was in place and working properly,
bilateral injected sclerae, doll's eyes.  Lungs revealed he
had decreased breath sounds throughout with coarse breath
sounds throughout, with some expiratory wheezes diffusely.
Heart was tachycardic without an murmur, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen was soft, obese, and nontender.  Extremities was
significant for 3 to 4+ pitting edema bilaterally which was
unchanged from previous discharge secondary to elephantiasis.
Neurologically, the patient withdrew to pain only on the
right lower extremity.  Right upper extremity with
purposeless movements.  The patient did not move his left
upper or lower extremity.  Of note, the patient was known to
not be able to move the left shoulder.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  He had a white blood cell
count of 8, hematocrit of 33.4, platelets of 208.  Sodium
of 139, potassium of 4.4, chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 20,
BUN of 44, creatinine of 3.4, glucose of 124.  Calcium
was 8.4, phosphorous 5.2, magnesium 2.  Creatine kinase #1
was 31.  Creatine kinases #2 and #3 were also flat.  Troponin
was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 46-year-old male patient recently
discharged after a prolonged Medical Intensive Care Unit stay
for multiple medical problems; now re-presenting to the
Emergency Room after a respiratory failure and pulseless
electrical activity arrest with cardioversion, and neural
changes consistent with a possible new cerebrovascular
accident.

1.  NEUROLOGY:  The patient's left-sided weakness was likely
secondary to an anoxic brain injury given history of mucous
plug and desaturation.  Throughout this hospital stay the
patient began to regain function in the extremities.  At the
time of discharge, the patient was able to lift the left
lower extremity against gravity and against some resistance;
although, it is still weak compared to the right side.  The
patient had a grasp on the left upper extremity and was able
to minimally move his left upper extremity.  The patient had
no deficits on the right side.

A Neurology consultation was obtained for further evaluation
of this possible stroke.  They also felt that it was
consistent an anoxic brain injury and likely area would
include the right parietal region.  A head CT was obtained
while the patient was in the hospital to further evaluate the
location of possible cerebrovascular accident.  The head CT
was pending at the time of this dictation, and an addendum
will be dictated as soon as the results are known.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was also being ruled out for
a myocardial infarction on this hospital admission.  Creatine
kinases times three as well as troponin were flat.  The
patient was effectively ruled out.  The patient's blood
pressure was stable throughout and did not require any
additional pressors.

The patient did have some bradycardic episodes during
dialysis which was consistent with his history of bradycardia
during dialysis.  Electrocardiograms obtained at this time
just showed sinus bradycardia.  The patient was asymptomatic
with these bradycardic episodes.  The patient had no acute
changes on the electrocardiogram.  An electrocardiogram
obtained at this hospital was consistent with previous
electrocardiograms.

3.  PULMONARY:  The patient had a tracheostomy in place and
it was functioning well.  The patient was kept on a 50%
tracheostomy mask ventilation assist control.  The tidal
volume was 700, respirations of 12, FIO2 of 50%, and a PEEP
of 5.

The patient's arterial blood gases were done throughout the
hospital stay, and last arterial blood gas was 7.39/40/182
and significantly improved.  The patient will need routine
tracheostomy care and suctioning as needed as the patient had
increased secretions while in the hospital.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Question of possible
tracheobronchitis given increased secretions.  A chest x-ray
was obtained during this hospital stay which showed possible
congestive heart failure, but no signs of a pneumonia.
Antibiotics were initially held but given the increased
secretions, the patient was started on levofloxacin for
possible tracheobronchitis.  Cultures obtained of the sputum
showed 3+ gram-positive rods which were most consistent with
oropharyngeal flora.  The patient will need to be continued
on levofloxacin for a total of seven days.

The patient also had a history of herpes zoster and was on
intravenous acyclovir.  The patient was given intravenous
acyclovir until [**10-10**] on hemodialysis days.  The
patient was afebrile throughout this hospital stay but did
have one low-grade fever of 100.8.  White count has been
stable.

5.  RENAL:  The patient was on chronic hemodialysis which was
started during previous hospital admission.  The patient has
been receiving Nephrocaps as well as Epogen at hemodialysis
and received one hemodialysis treatment this recent hospital
admission on the day prior to discharge.

6.  CODE STATUS:  Code status on this admission was
re-addressed with the wife, and the patient is still full
code.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Estar-Gel.
 2.  Hibiclens soaks.
 3.  Epogen 10,000 units three times a week at hemodialysis.
 4.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 5.  Senna 2 tablets p.o. q.d.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was stable at the time
of discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to [**Hospital6 **] where the patient will receive
additional hemodialysis treatments as well as management of
ventilation.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Of note, please suction tracheostomy
secretions routinely as the patient has had increased
secretions on this admission and is at risk for plugging up
the tracheostomy which is what apparently happened
previously.  The patient will requiring days of levofloxacin
for a total of a 7-day course, and acyclovir can be stopped
on [**10-10**].  The patient should be on contact precautions
until then.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Respiratory failure with associated
possible cardiac arrest, status post mucous plus in
tracheostomy.

in CHB and is s/p temporary pacing wire placement. According to
wife, patient has had progressive DOE over the past few weeks.
He has also had increased LE edema recently. No known complaints
of chest pain. He returned home after coaching a baseball game
today and collapsed. He was found to be pulseless. A neighbor
who is an [**Name (NI) 9168**] was called, and began administering CPR. EMS
arrived ~15min later and found pt to be in VF. One shock was
administered and he returned to sinus rhythm. He was nasally
intubated in the field. En route, he was found to be
progressively bradycardic, and his rhythm was c/w CHB. He was
taken to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital and a temporary pacing wire was
placed through the R IJ (apparently done under unsterile
conditions). He was changed to oral intubation. He received IV
metoprolol, NTG gtt, atropine, and Versed. Bedside TTE showed EF
30-35% with anterio AK, 2+ TR, 2+ MR. CK was 337 with negative

Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Cardiac arrest: On admission, it was reported that he had a VF
arrest by EMS, and converted with 1 shock in the field.  EP,
however, felt his cardiac arrest was more likely secondary to
polymorphic VT as a result of his prolonged QT and complete
heart block.  He had no CAD on cath so it was likely not
ischemic in etiology.  Despite the suspicion for polymorphic VT,
EP felt primary VF could not be ruled out, so an ICD was placed
on [**3-12**].
.
# Complete heart block:  He had a temporary pacing wire placed
at the outside hospital, and was V-paced at 60bpm.  His native
heart rate was less than 30.  The etiology of his complete heart
block was thought to be secondary to degenerative conduction
disease, as he seems to have had progressive conduction
abnormalities per past EKGs.  Viral myocarditis was also
considered a possibility as his family gave a history of
flu-like symptoms a few days before his cardiac arrest.  His TSH
was normal and his cath was clean.  A dual chamber ICD was
placed on [**3-12**].  He was maintained on a beta blocker for rate
control as his rate was in the 90s after his dual chamber ICD
was placed.  He developed a hematoma from his ICD site,
involving his left shoulder and inner arm.  His heparin drip was
discontinued, and his hematoma resolved into an ecchymosis that
has been stable.  He has an appointment in device clinic for
interrogation of his ICD the day after discharge.  He will
follow up this and his other cardiac issues with his
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**].
.
# AVR: He is on Coumadin as an inpatient for his mechanical
aortic valve.  He received vitamin K 5mg po on [**3-9**] to reverse
his INR in preparation for his ICD placement.  IV heparin was
restarted s/p ICD placement.  His mechanical aortic valve was
found to be functioning well on TTE.  He was restarted on
Coumadin, and his INR was therapeutic for a few days before
admission.  He was discharged on Coumadin 5mg po daily with the
plan to get her INR checked 4 days after discharge.  He will
resume management of his anticoagulation with his PCP.
.
# Anoxic encephalopathy:  According to the family, there was an
approximate 5-minute lapse between his collapse at home and
initiation of CPR.  He was initially minimally responsive when
intubated, even with lightening of sedation.  His CT head showed
no intracranial hemorrhage.  Fortunately, he began to recover
some cortical function within 48 hours of his cardiac arrest,
and began to follow commands.  Upon extubation and
discontinuation of his sedation, he was disoriented and became
agitated, responding well to olanzapine.  He was maintained on
olanzapine for a couple of days, and his agitation resolved.  He
also seemed to have some motor difficulty with impaired hand-eye
coordination, as well as some short-term memory deficit.  His
cognitive and motor deficits are likely due to anoxic
encephalopathy.  He has experienced rapid improvement while in
the hospital.  He was evaluated by Occupational Therapy and
Physical Therapy, and felt to be safe to be discharged home.  He
will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Behavioral
Neurology in 6 weeks for reassessment.
.
# Respiratory status:  He was initially intubated for airway
protection during cardiac arrest.  He had mild pulmonary edema
on chest x-ray, for which he received IV Lasix for diuresis.  He
was weaned from the ventilator over the next couple of days, and
was extubated on [**3-13**].  He had a possible infiltrate on chest
x-ray and a leukocytosis, so he received a 7-day course of
levofloxacin and vancomycin for empiric treatment of VAP.  He
was weaned off oxygen and had good sats with ambulation upon
discharge.
.
# CAD: No CAD on cath.  He was continued on aspirin and his
outpatient dose of statin.
.
# CHF: He likely has diastolic dysfunction with his aortic
stenosis and hypertension.  His TTE showed an EF of 60%.  His
CHF symptoms were possibly due to progressive bradycardia and
complete heart block.  He was volume overloaded on admission.
He diuresed well on IV Lasix, and was euvolemic for several days
before discharge.  He was maintained on a BB and ACE-inhibitor.
.
# DM2:  His blood sugars were initially well-controlled on
sliding scale insulin, but he had poor po intake.  He was
restarted on his metformin after he resumed his diet.
.
# Leukocytosis:  His initial leukocytosis was felt to be
secondary to a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia.  He was
initially treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  Ceftriaxone
was discontinued for a possible drug rash.  He was switched to
levofloxacin and maintained on vancomycin, and completed a 7-day
course of antibiotics.  His leukocytosis resolved initially, but
then recurred, while still on antibiotics.  He had no localizing
symptoms, a clear chest x-ray, and negative UA and culture.  As
the origin for the elevated WBC count could not be identified,
his antibiotics were discontinued at the end of his 7-day course
for VAP.  He was discharged to PCP follow up, with a check of
his WBC count in 4 days after discharge.
.
# FEN:  After extubation, he had a video swallow evaluation that
showed aspiration of a regular diet.  He was found to tolerate
ground solids and thin liquids with careful swallowing and
strict aspiration precautions.  He was discharged home on this
diet.  Speech and Swallow recommended repeat video swallow
evaluation in 2 weeks to reassess his aspiration risk, and
hopefully clear him for regular diet.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 year old male with no known past medical history admitted
with VF arrest while at the Red Sox game.  He underwent CPR in
the field along with defibrillation and transition to atrial
fibrillation.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU and was
initiated on the Arctic Sun cooling protocol for cardiac arrest.
 Initial echocardiogram showed severe mitral valve prolapse and
regurgitation with a flail mitral valve, which was most likely
the precipitant of his VF arrest. The patient was extubated
successfully approximately 48 hours after rewarming. Upon
admission, he was started on empiric antibiotic therapy for
possible aspiration pneumonia with cefepime, vancomycin and
metronidazole. He was taken to the operating [**2179-10-7**] and
underwent left sided maze procedure and Mitral Valve repair (see
operative note for full details). Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
Vancomycin was used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, given
the length of preoperative stay.  POD 1 found the patient
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The
patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable,
weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  Amiodarone was
started for atrial fibrillation.  Beta blocker was initiated and
the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
Intra-operatively, the patient was found to have an osteoporotic
appearing sternum.  [**Month/Day/Year 6091**] was consulted and has
recommended outpatient follow up following recovery from cardiac
surgery.  The patient continued to exhibit dysphagia, and
dobhoff tube was placed for feeding purposes.  Coumadin was
started for atrial fibrillation.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  A dual chamber ACID was
placed on [**2179-10-13**] without complication. This was interrogated
[**10-14**] and follow up appointment with the device clinic was
arranged. He had a repeat video swallow study and was cleared
for nectar thick ground diet and tube feeds were cycled. His
Dobhoff tube was removed on day of discharge and patient was
instructed by the speech and swallow team for aspiration
precautions. He is to follow up as an outpatient with a video
swallow study (scheduled) for diet advancement.  He was started
on an ACE-I for EF 35% once blood pressure tolerated.  His INR
was 2.3 on the day of discharge and he was given 1 mg of
Coumadin with plans to have INR drawn [**10-15**] with results to be
called in to [**Hospital3 271**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2173**] for further
Coumadin dosing instructions.  INR goal [**2-3**] for atrial
fibrillation.  By the time of discharge on POD 7 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing well with staples in
place and pain was controlled with oral analgesics and he was
tolerating a ground diet.  The patient was discharged home with
services in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions and follow up appointments arranged.

arrest with return of spontaneous circulation.
.
History taken from wife.  The patient had been in her usual
state of health, watching the celtics game with her wife when
she became unresponsive.  At approximately 9:30, patient
appeared to slump to one side with ""funny"" breathing and became
non-respnosive.  Earlier that night, she had been drinking a

leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size with severe global
dysfunction c/w diffuse process. No valvular pathology or
pathologic flow identified.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2156-5-31**] at 3:59:26 PM  The left
atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2156-5-24**], the left ventricular systolic function
has improved to normal.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2156-5-26**]
9:05 AM FINDINGS: There is a tiny filling defect in a
subsegmental artery within the right middle lobe (3:41 and
403B:46). No other filling defects are seen. There is no
dissection. There is bibasilar atelectasis with no evidence of
aspiration pneumonia. The heart size is normal without
pericardial effusion. There is no hilar, axillary, or
mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The endotracheal tube ends
approximately 2.8 cm above the carina. An NG tube is coiled
within the stomach, completely seen on the coronal scout view.
There is a nodular soft tissue density within the left breast
which measures 2.0 cm x 1.3 cm. Although this examination is not
tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the visualized aspects
of the upper abdomen are within normal limits. BONE WINDOWS:
There is a slight anterior cortical deformity to the sternum,
seen on the sagittal reformats. This may be the sequelae of CPR.
Otherwise, no concerning osseous lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION: 1. Tiny filling defect within a subsegmental
pulmonary artery in the right middle lobe. This may represent a
tiny pulmonary embolism. However, no other filling defects
noted. 2. Bibasilar atelectasis with no evidence of aspiration
pneumonia. 3. Soft tissue density nodule in the left breast.
Please correlate with mammography.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2156-5-27**] 7:37 AM FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema,
mass, mass effect, or large vascular territorial infarction. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in configuration. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. There is no shift of
normally midline structures. The suprasellar and quadrigeminal
cisterns are preserved. There is no acute fracture. The middle
ear cavities and mastoid air cells and included views of the
paranasal sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial
process.
.
EEG Study Date of [**2156-5-24**] FINDINGS:  SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS:
No true interictal epileptiform discharges were seen; most of
these were detections of somewhat sharply contoured background
activity. A few sharp transients were seen, particularly in the
bifrontal region, but these were not definitely epileptiform.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: No true electrographic seizures were
seen. Most of these were detections of particularly rhythmic
periods of a slow background. Selected review of the video
demonstrated no apparent change in the patient's clinical status
in association with these detections. PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS:
There were none. CONTINUOUS EEG MONITORING: Review of time
sampled excerpts of continuous EEG recording demonstrated that
the background was typically of very low voltage and very slow
usually in the delta frequency range although occasional
intermixed theta frequency activity was seen at times. Bursts of
generalized polymorphic delta frequency slowing and theta
frequency slowing were also seen. SLEEP: No normal sleep
architecture was seen. CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally
regular rhythm. IMPRESSION: This video EEG telemetry captured no
pushbutton activations. No electrographic seizures or interictal
epileptiform discharges were seen. The background was mostly
slow and disorganized throughout the day's recording suggestive
of a moderate encephalopathy. Such an encephalopathy can be
caused by hypoxic ischemic injury, medications, metabolic
disturbances, and other etiologies.
.
EEG Study Date of [**2156-5-31**] FINDINGS: SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS:
These were artifactual; no true interictal epileptiform
discharges were seen. SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: These were
artifactual; no true electrographic seizures were seen.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none. ROUTINE TIME SAMPLING:
Showed a background that did reach a normal alpha frequency at
times during wakefulness but was more commonly slow and
disorganized often in the theta and delta frequency ranges. At
times, blunted sharp wave morphologies were seen over the
occipital regions, particularly on the left, and sometimes
recurred in the theta frequency range particularly over the O1
electrode. Selected review of the video demonstrated no apparent
change in the patient's appearance in association with these
periods of sharp blunted theta activity. SLEEP: No normal sleep
morphologies were seen. CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally
regular rhythm. IMPRESSION: This video EEG telemetry captured no
pushbutton activations. No electrographic seizures were seen.
There were some blunted sharp waves seen over the left occipital
region sometimes recurrent in the theta frequency range for a
few seconds at a time and these suggested a potential focus of
epileptogenesis. For most of the recording, the background was
slightly slow and disorganized, suggestive of a mild
encephalopathy.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
44 year old woman with history of hypothyroidism, asthma,
depression, GERD, ETOH abuse who was found down s/p VF arrest
with return of spontaneous circulation.
.
# Status post cardiac arrest:  Patient presented status post VF
arrest while at home.  The etiology is unknown, but suspected to
be related to electrolyte disturbances in the setting of alcohol
abuse.  Patient had positive cardiac enzymes which were likely
elevated secondary to her cardiac arrest as opposed to primary
ischemic event.  ECG did not demonstrate t-wave inversions,
st-elevations, or signs of ischemia, or prolonged QT interval.
An echocardiogram was done that showed normal LA, LV, RV cavity
size, mild regional LV dysfunction w/ akinesis of the distal
half of the anterior wall and severe hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 25%). Echo findings were thought to
be secondary to post-cardiac arrest vs underlying
cardiomyopathy.  Patient underwent hypothermia protocol and then
re-warming.  On admission, she was continued on amiodarone and
pressors but these were stopped subsequently. Pt was cooled
using ArticSun according to post-arrest protocol. Continous EEG
did not show evidence of seizures.  Urine/Serum tox were
remarkable for elevated ETOH levels.  Patient was extubated
successfully [**5-28**]. Echo on [**5-31**] showed that left ventricular
function improved to normal (LVEF 55-60%). Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation was seen, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure was normal. An ICD placement was discussed but per EP's
recommendations and given current neurological status was not
placed. Patient will be given LifeVest upon discharge to neuro
rehab facility and reassessed as an outpatient for further
intervention.
.
# Neuro / ETOH withdrawal: After extubation, patient went into
delerium tremors, becoming very agitated with jerky movements
though responsive throughout these episodes and autonomic
dysfunction.  She was placed on CIWA scale.  She was started on
standing ativan, and ativan prn.  Neuro was re-consulted who
placed continous EEG monitoring that showed background slowing
suggestive of mild encephalopathy but no seizure activity.
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended an ativan taper which
was copmleted before discharge, as well as evening doses of
zyprexa 5mg to help the patient sleep and prevent nighttime
agitation. Neurology recommended transfer to rehab facility for
neuro rehab, like post-anoxic brain injury.
.
# Infection: Pt began spiking fevers on [**5-26**] to 100.8, she was
pancultured and sputum culture eventually revealed coag + staph
aureus. She copmleted an 8 day course for aspiration pneumonia.
She spiked fevers again on [**5-28**]. Her central line was removed
and a PICC was placed, a course of vancomycin was started but
discontinued after 8 days because pt pulled out PICC line and
reinsertion of line posed a greater risk for infection than
truncating vanco course. C diff was negative. Pt was afebrile
for 48 hrs prior to discharge. Blood cultures from [**6-3**] and [**6-4**]
are NGTD at the time of this summary.
.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH was 4.6.  Patient was continued on
synthroid.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
Cardiac Arrest
.
Secondary:
Anoxic brain injury
Alcohol withdrawal


Discharge Condition:
Pt's chest pain is currently mild and controlled by Ibufprofen
and Oxycodone. She has residual cognitive deficits post-arrest;
she is alert and oriented to self, but not to place or time. Her
agitation is relieved by evening doses of Zyrpexa. She is able
to ambulate with assistance.


Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**].
.
You were admitted to the hospital because of cardiac arrest. You
were shocked and resuscitated. You were on a ventilator for a
time and extubated when stable. You were also treated with
therapeutic cooling. Neurologically your functional status
improved and you will be transferred to a neurological
rehabilitation facility to further improve your status. You will
be leaving the hospital with a LifeVest, which is a vest you
wear that helps to detect and correct abnormal rhythms in your
heart. An echocardiogram done before you left the hospital
showed that the function of your heart was largely back to
normal.

It is very important that you stop drinking alcohol.  It is
possible that alcohol caused electrolyte imablances in your body
that may have caused your caridac arrest. While you were in the
hospital you went into alcohol withdrawal.

We have made the following changes to your medications:
1.Start Thiamine, Folic acid and a multivitamin for your
nutrition
2. Start Aspirin to prevent a heart attack
3. Start Heparin injections to prevent a blood clot unless you
are up and out of bed at least three times daily
4. Start senna and colace to prevent constipation
5. Start Tylenol and Ibuprofen around the clock to treat your
chest soreness
6. Start Oxycodone to treat chest soreness that is not relieved
by tylenol and Ibuprofen
7. Start Omeprazole to prevent heartburn
8. Start Olanzapine to treat any agitation and help you sleep.
9. Start white petrolatum to treat your dry eyes
10. Stop Hydrochlorothiazide/Triamterene, Fluticasone inhaler
and Fluoxetine.
11. Start Metoprolol to help prevent irregular heart rhythms.

COMPARISON: CT head of [**2188-9-11**].

FINDINGS: Study is limited by motion artifact degrading multiple
axial slices
at the vertex and skull base. Some of the axial slices at the
vertex were
subsequently repeated. Despite limitations as described above,
there is no
evidence of acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally
midline
structures, hydrocephalus, or evidence of major territorial
infarct. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation appears preserved. The major
intracranial
cisterns are preserved.

The extra-calvarial soft tissues are unremarkable. The
visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells appear clear.

IMPRESSION: Moderately limited study. While no evidence of major
territorial
infarct is identified, given patient's status of cardiac
pacemaker, a CT
perfusion is recommended if continued concern for infarction is
present.

[**2189-9-15**] TTE
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypertrophied left ventricle with severe
global hypokinesis. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate to severe
pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2189-9-2**], the left ventricle is more dilated.
The other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
46yo male with PMHx CAD, cardiac arrest s/p ICD placement, and
EF 20% presenting with metabolic derangements and cardiac
arrest. Appears to have developed AFlu/Atach then became
acidotic/hyperkalemic w/evolution to VFib that was not detected
by ICD, possibly b/c the acidemia decreased the sensitivity.
.
# Cardiac Rhythm: The etiology for his cardiac arrest was
initially unclear but included hyperkalemia vs ischemic. Because
three sets of cardiac enzymes were never elevated, it was
believed that this was not due to ACS. After further review of
OSH records, it was proposed that he went int atrial
flutter/atrial tachycardia which led to hypoperfusion
w/development of acidosis and consequent hyperkalemia leading to
evolution into ventricular fibrillation. It was initially
thought that his ICD did not detect this event because of
decreased sensitivity of the leads in the setting of acidemia,
but further evaluation by the electrophysiology team concluded
that the ICD lead anomaly was unrelated to the incident. In his
recent admission from 2 wks ago, ICD interrogation showed normal
sensing function but malfunction of the generator lead; however,
it was not fixed because of an inability to correct his elevated
INR. Therefore, during this admission, the goal was to correct
the lead. In the mean time, he was maintained on his amiodarone
and lopressor and was in NSR with his baseline LBBB.

After being transferred to the cardiology floor, ICD revision
was planned but the patient developed thrombophlebitis of the
right arm on the evening prior to transfer.  He was started on
cephalexin and an ultrasound demonstrated thrombus throughout
the course of the cephalic and in the basillic vein to the mid
arm.  He was later sent to interventional radiology for PICC
placement proximal to the clot but nonocclusive, soft thrombus
was then identified in his brachial vein of the right arm.  Note
that the left arm holds his AV fistula.

Because the procedure could not be performed while the patient
had an ongoing infection with possible vascular involvement, it
was postponed until the patient completed his antibiotics.  He
was also instructed to restart anticoagulation with warfarin.
He will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by the [**Hospital **] clinic for readmission.

# CAD/Ischemia: His cardiac enzymes had an MB index of less than
5% over three sets so he ruled out ACS. He complained of MSK
pain over his precordium which was treated with analgesics. He
was maintained on ASA and an ACE inbitior was initiated.  He was
continued on his home meds (without the ACEi) at the time of
d/c.
.
# Pump: Although clinically the patient did not complain of
dyspnea and on physicial exam he did not have crackles nor
peripheral edema, it was known that he had a dilated CMP. Given
the setting of his cardiac arrest, we repeated a TTE which
showed a stable low EF with worsening left ventricular
dilatation and no thrombus.

# Hyperkalemia/ESRD: His admission K was 5.7 and initially he
was not HD as there was no clear indication. He was treated with
kayexelate PRN over his first night and his K was maintained
around 5.5. He underwent a mini HD session on [**9-15**] which was
tolerated well, w/a post HD potassium of 4.9. His EKG remained
w/o signs of hyperkalemia and he was treated with HD as per
renal; he was maintained on his baseline renal meds.

# Neuro: He was initially arousable but sleepy and confused,
unaware of year, location nor president; on exam, had
hyperreflexia and positive [**Doctor Last Name **] concerning for upper motor
neuron injury; it was unclear whether there may be a Sz
component as father also has ?Sz. Neuro saw pt the night of his
admission and felt he had diffuse encephalopathy but perhaps a
focal lesion on R given hyperreflexia L>R. NCCT was done which
was unremarkable. The patient had a trial of low dose diazepam
w/decrease in myoclonus. The morning after, neuro felt there was
improvement in the myoclonus and needed only observation.

# Anemia/INR: Has long-standing anemia likely [**1-24**] ESRD with an
elevated MCV; Vitamin B12 and folate were normal and iron
studies were c/w anemia of chronic disease. His Hct remained
stable. His INR was elevated at admission to 1.8 and in his
recent admission, it was this intractable INR that had prevented
him from getting an ICD lead revision. He did not respond to low
dose vitamin K. A relative[**Name (NI) **] recent US and CT of the abdomen
had not shown any liver lesions although he did have a
chronically elevated AlkPhos but exhibited normal albumin
levels. Per renal, he was to begin EPO.

2) Resting hemodynamics revealed [**Month/Year (2) **] right and left sided
filling pressures with a reduced cardiac output.  There was no
evidence of an intracardiac shunt.
3) Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid and distal RCA with a
3.5 mm Cypher stent (posted to 3.5 mm with an NC balloon) and a
3.0 mm Cypher stent (posted to 3.0 mm with an NC balloon)
respectively.  Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis,

2.25x12 mm MicroDriver bare metal stent.  Final angiography
revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
(see PTCA comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.

Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is
seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
62F h/o hyperlipidemia, tobacco abuse found down with VF arrest
s/p defibrillation and PCI with DES to RCA and BMS to D1 thought
most likely secondary to ischemia and s/p ICD placement.
Hospital course complicated by atrial fibrillation.
.
# Ischemia: Patient had a coronary intervention of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to
RCA and BMS to D1 (dissection) as the CKs peaked at 109.  Pt
recovered well from procedure and was continued on aspirin,
plavix, statin, metoprolol 75mg tid and transitioned from
captopril to lisinopril.
.
# Pump: The patient was found to have preserved EF with normal
wall motion. 3+MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 101624**] and right heart pressures
intially. Autodiuresing, currently euvolemic.  Pt's I/O goal was
kept even.  An outpatient echo to eval MR (consider MR repair)
needs to be addressed as an outpatient.  Patient needs
antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures.
.
# Rhythm: As noted above, patient had a VF arrest, likely [**3-6**]
ischemia. She converted in and out of various rhythms initially,
paroxysmal SVT including A fib/flutter/tach with episodic
polymorphic VT or torsades, s/p defib -> AF -> sinus.  She was
on a lidocaine bolus and gtt, with subsequent discontinuation.
Her ICD placement was initially deferred [**3-6**] UTI, which was
treated with 3 days of bactrim.  Patient was kept on telemetry,
had [**Hospital1 **] lytes, and an EP consult.  An ICD was placed on [**12-29**]
and her lytes were maximized at K>4.5, Mg>2.2. Post-ICD
placement, her course was further complicated by heart rhythm of
atrial fibrillation with RVR. She was once inappropriately
shocked from her ICD due to a.fib with RVR. Patient had three
unsuccessful cardioversion attempts. She was ultimately
controlled with PO rhythm management with sotalol and diltiazem
with anticoagulation with warfarin.
.
# Respiratory: Intubated initially, s/p extubation [**12-24**].  Upon
discharge, had no difficulty with her respiratory status as she
remained on RA.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic. Stable. C-scope normal 5/[**2177**]. B12,
folate, retic count.  Her iron studies c/w ACD and her Hct
remained stable.
.
# C-spine: found down, unwitnessed. CT C-spine neg for fracture
or malalignment. Spine team cleared C-spine [**12-24**].
.
# UTI: on bactrim x 3 days.  Patient's symptoms improved after
treatment and was asymptomatic at time of discharge.

Date of Birth:   [**2111-9-23**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  V-fib arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 19 year old
female with no past medical history found dyspneic by her
roommate in her dorm room, and subsequently syncopal.  The BU
police were called, hooked up an automated defibrillator which
advised shock.  Patient was defibrillated.  Subsequently EMT
arrived.  Patient was in complete heart block with slow escape.
She was intubated and given epinephrine times four, atropine
times three.  She subsequently became tachycardiac, again went
into ventricular fibrillation, was shocked times two and started
on lidocaine bolus and then drip.  She was then transported to
[**Hospital1 69**].  In the emergency
department patient was given 4 liters of fluid.  She was given
magnesium and charcoal, 2 gm of IV calcium.  Her workup included
a head CT which was negative.  Chest CT showed no evidence of PE.
Subsequently in the emergency department patient was becoming
progressively more hypoxic and difficult to ventilate,
requiring bagging and continuous suctioning of pink frothy
secretions.  Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.  She became
more hypotensive as well with a nadir blood pressure in the
50s to 60s systolic requiring Neosynephrine drip with
sedation and paralysis.  She became easier to ventilate after
that.  She was then transferred to the cardiac
catheterization lab on 20 mcg per kg of Neosynephrine for PA
catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump placement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Adderall which is
dextroamphetamine and racemic amphetamine, oral contraceptive
pills, ephedrine containing diet medication.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a sophomore at [**University/College **].

FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of sudden death.  No history of
coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 96, rising to
99.8; heart rate in the 120s to 130s; blood pressure 50s to
110s systolic, 30s to 70s diastolic; O2 sat ranging from 82%
to 92% on 100% O2 and 10 of PEEP.  In general, intubated,
sedated, overbreathing the vent.  HEENT charcoal stained, ET
tube.  Carotid pulses 2+.  Thorax coarse bilaterally breath
sounds.  Cardiovascular exam regular tachycardiac, no RV
heave, distant heart sounds.  Extremities warm with no edema.
Neurological exam intubated, sedated, thrashing about and
bucking vent.  One episode of extensor posturing.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood count 9.6,
hematocrit 37.7, platelets 381.  PT 13.3, PTT 23, INR 1.2.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.1, chloride 97, bicarbonate 15, BUN
11, creatinine 1.2, glucose 238.  ALT 21, AST 38, alka phos
62, bili 0.4.  CK 230, MB 3, troponin less than 0.3.  Lactate
at 10:00 a.m. was 10.1, at 10:38 a.m. was 4.8 and at 4:12
p.m. was 2.0.  Free calcium was 1.08.  Urinalysis #1 showed
specific gravity of greater than 1.030 with greater than 300
protein, no glucose, trace ketones, no leukocyte esterase, 11
to 20 RBCs, 3 to 5 white blood cells.  UA #2 showed similar
results.  Serum tox no aspirin, alcohol, acetaminophen,
benzos, no barbiturates, no tricycles.  Urine tox was
positive for amphetamines, otherwise negative.  ABG #1 was
7.35, 36, 250.  Patient was put on IMV with settings of 500,
14, 100% FIO2 and 5 of PEEP.  Chest x-ray showed initially
mild interstitial edema at 10:00 a.m. and at 4:10 p.m. showed
worsening CHF and interval placement of a right IJ sheath.
Head CT showed no evidence of acute bleeding or intracerebral
hemorrhage.  Chest CT showed no evidence of pulmonary
embolism, patchy bilateral opacities.  EKG taken from strips
from the EMTs showed complete heart block with slow
junctional escape, then sinus, then v-fib, after shocking
back to sinus.  EKG on arrival showed sinus tachycardia with
normal axis.  Echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis with
severely depressed LVEF.  Left atrium was normal in size.
Left ventricle mildly dilated.  Right ventricle normal in
size.  Right ventricular systolic function was somewhat
depressed, 1+ MR, no pericardial effusion.

The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab
where PA cath showed RA mean of 19, RV of 49/12, PA of 43/28,
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 30 to 31, PA sat of
57%, cardiac index of 1.7.  Patient was placed on dopamine in
the cath lab.  Neo-Synephrine was weaned off and an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  Left sided
catheterization showed a right dominant system with normal
coronary arteries.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 19 year old female status post
v-fib arrest now in normal sinus rhythm in cardiogenic shock
with nonischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology and
arrhythmia of unclear etiology.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular.
Coronaries.  There was no evidence of ischemia during initial
evaluation and cardiac catheterization showed no evidence of
lesions in the coronary arteries.

Pump.  Initially the patient was found to be in cardiogenic
shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump and pressors
including dopamine and dobutamine with global hypokinesis and
EF estimated to be about 20% with depressed cardiac output
and cardiac index.  On [**1-9**] dopamine and dobutamine
were slowly weaned.  Repeat echocardiogram was performed
which showed no significant interval change from
echocardiogram done on admission.  Patient's cardiac output
and index remained stable off the pressors.  The intra-aortic
balloon pump was discontinued on [**2131-1-10**].
Pressures continued to be consistently with mean arterial
pressures greater than 70.  Patient was gradually diuresed
with IV Lasix and over the course of the next three days
achieved a euvolemic volume status.

Rhythm.  The patient was started on an IV amiodarone drip as
prophylaxis against further episodes of ventricular
fibrillation.  After two days there were no episodes of
significant ectopy and amiodarone was discontinued and then
changed to p.o. amiodarone.  From [**1-11**] onward patient
was no longer having episodes of hypotension, no longer
requiring pressors and no longer needed arterial line or PA
catheter monitoring and these were discontinued.  At this
time it is still unclear what the etiology of the
cardiomyopathy is.  Possibilities include viral myocarditis
as well as the possibility of drug (ephedrine) induced myopathy.

2.  Pulmonary.  The patient was initially intubated for
hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to cardiac arrest.  Was
maintained on a propofol drip for adequate sedation while
intubated as patient was often fighting the vent when off
sedation.  Settings were kept on assist control with several
episodes of acute desaturation whenever patient was moved.
The pulmonary service was consulted and recommended
decreasing the tidal volume as well as the FIO2 as well as
further diuresis, all of which were done.  By [**1-12**]
FIO2 had been weaned down to 40% and assist control was
changed over to pressure support of 15 and PEEP of 7.5 with
continued adequate oxygenation as well as ventilation.
Sedation was gradually titrated down and patient continued to
have adequate tidal volumes on pressure support.  Chest x-ray
on [**2131-1-12**], showed evidence of left lower lobe
opacity consistent with atelectasis.  Post suctioning and
repositioning as well as aggressive chest P.T., these chest
x-ray findings resolved and there were no further episodes of
desaturation.  From the pulmonary edema standpoint patient
was started on captopril for afterload reduction which she
tolerated well and captopril was increased gradually to 37.5
mg p.o. t.i.d.  She continued to have adequate oxygenation
and ventilation and no further evidence of pulmonary edema.
On [**1-16**] she began to develop increasing stridor as
well as copious secretions which were becoming more profound.
Pulmonary consult recommended a tracheostomy which was
performed on [**2131-1-16**], by interventional
pulmonology.  After tracheostomy placement, trials of mask
ventilation through the tracheostomy allowed adequate tidal
volumes as well as oxygenation and ventilation with SIMV as
backup at night.

3.  Infectious disease.  On initial presentation to the
cardiac intensive care unit patient was noted to have a fever
of 102.8.  Blood cultures were sent as well as chest x-ray
and urinalysis, none of which grew any bacteria.  There was
no evidence of infiltrates and no evidence of a urinary
infection.  Antibiotics were started with vancomycin,
levofloxacin and Flagyl for broad spectrum coverage for
possible seeding from line placement in the emergency
department.  Patient continued to be febrile for several
days, then running a low grade temperature of about 100 to
100.4 throughout her hospital stay with no further spiking
fever.  Antibiotics were discontinued on day seven.  There
was no further evidence of bacterial infection with negative
blood cultures on repeated occasions as well as negative
urinalysis.  Patient was noted to have some conjunctivitis on
the second day of her hospital stay.  Viral cultures were
sent from swabs from the eye and showed no evidence of any
viral growth.

4.  Neuro.  The patient suffered a significant amount of
hypoperfusion and anoxic brain injury due to the cardiac arrest.
For the first four days she was on propofol sedation and
neurological status was somewhat difficult to assess.  However,
after propofol was discontinued, there was very little evidence
of purposeful movement, very little withdrawal to pain and
patient was not able to follow commands consistently.  At times
she was noted to have dilated pupils and gaze deviation which
resolved on their own.  EEG was performed, the results of which
seemed consistent with medication related effect versus toxic
metabolic injury.  There was no evidence of seizure activity.
MRI showed diffuse anoxic brain injury with multiple areas of
cortical white matter infarcts.  Head CT showed no evidence
of edema.  However, on funduscopic exam there was some
evidence of papilledema.  The head of the bed was elevated,
but given the mildness of the increased intracranial pressure
there was no indication for using diuresis with mannitol or
administration of steroids.  Neurology service was consulted
and felt that the overall prognosis for recovery was minimal
given the findings on MRI as well as the prognosis post
cardiac arrest with 93% chance for permanent disability with
only about 7% chance of any significant functional improvement.
These findings were conveyed to the family who still are
maintaining hopes of eventual recovery.

5.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition.  The patient was
initially started on tube feeds as well as Reglan for
promotility and Colace and senna for a bowel regimen.  On
[**2131-1-19**], patient underwent percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy placement by the gastroenterology service without
complications.  This will be used for further tube feedings.

6.  Access.  Initially the patient had a right internal
jugular Cordis for central access.  This was then resited to
a left internal jugular Cordis on [**1-10**].  Central
access was then discontinued on [**2131-1-13**], as there
was no further need for any central access medications or
monitoring.  Arterial line placed on [**2131-1-8**], was
continued until [**2131-1-12**], when A-line monitoring was
no longer needed.  On [**2131-1-18**], a peripherally
inserted central catheter was placed for long term access.

Further hospital course to be dictated at a later date.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 y/o schoolteacher w/ HTN admitted to CCU s/p
cardiac arrest while walking into school this AM. Per report,
CPR was initiated by her co-workers. When EMS arrived she was
found pulseless and apneic and one shock was delivered. She was
then found to be breathing at a RR of 10 with a rapid pulse, but
was still unresponsive. She was bolused 100 mg of lidocaine IO.
Cardiac monitor per EMS report showed sinus tach at rate of 140
with a BP of 150/100. Patient then became responsive. Lidocaine
infusion at 1 mg/min was started. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED for further management.
In the ED, intial VS: Temp: 98.6 HR: 115 BP:147/92. The
lidocaine gtt was stopped. She was given 50 mg of fentanyl and 4
mg of zofran for chest pain and nausea.
The patient states she felt herself ""blackout"" immediately
before the arrest and remembered nothing else. She denies
pre-syncope, syncope, palpitations, chest pain or sob. She has
had atypical exertional chest pain since [**Month (only) 116**] of this year,
having severe neck pain radiating to shoulders in the morning
during light exertion, lasting less than 5 minutes. She had a
stress test which was equivical and subsequently had a cardiac
cath at [**Hospital1 2025**] which was normal per patient. She admits to the
sensation this morning, prior to her arrest.
.
In the ED she was seen by the EP service who placed ICD for
secondary prevention. She was then transferred to CCU for
further monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo Female with h/o HTN, who is admitted for cardiac arrest.

#. Cardiac Arrest: Pt received one shock in the field suggestive
of VF or VT rhythm. Cardiac cath showed 80% LAD occlusion which
was the culprit lesion, s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. Echo revealed preserved
cardiac function. EP followed patient, decision was made not to
place ICD since the LAD occlusion was the source of the cardiac
arrest.
.
#. CAD: Pt with 80% occlusions of LAD s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. This LAD
lesion was 20% in [**5-/2183**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] cardiac cath. Pt was started on
medical management for CAD. Metoprolol, atorvastatin, ASA 325mg,
plavix, [**Last Name (un) **] was started in lieu of ACE-I secondary to allergy.
Her lipid panel revealed TAG 154, HDL 50, LDL 104. Started on
atorvastatin 80mg daily Her HbA1c was pending at time of
discharge.
.
# HTN: Held home dilt. Started metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and will go
home on metoprolol.
.
#LFTs: Pts LFTs were found to be elevated (400s ALT, 200s AST).
They trended down mildly. Differential included components of
shock liver in setting of cardiac arrest versus underlying
chronic transaminits (possible NASH). Patient should follow this
up outpatient.
.
#Chest Pain: Pt had chest pain from chest compressions and
likely underlying rib fx. CXR was neg for obvious fractures. Pt
was treated with narcotics and tramadol for pain which
controlled symtoms.

Pt will go home with VNA services

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to take care of you during this
hospitalization. You were admitted to the hospital for cardiac
arrest. Essentially, your heart was beating in a bad rhythm and
not pumping blood forward. You were found to have a clogged
artery going to your heart which explained why you went into
cardiac arrest. The artery was opened with a stent. You were
started on several new medications to protect your heart. It is
very important to take these medications every day. You also had
chest pain which was attributed to rib fractures from chest
compressions during CPR. This is treated with rest and pain
medications.

Please follow  up with your primary care doctor at the
appointment below. It is also important to follow up with a
cardiologist.

Please refrain from strenuous activity for one week. Follow up
with your cardiologist.

The following changes were made to your medications:

STOP Diltiazem

START:
Atorvastatin 80mg daily
Clopidogrel 75 mg daily
Metoprolol Succinate 50mg daily
Valsartan 80mg daily
Ultram 50mg every 6 hours as needed for pain
